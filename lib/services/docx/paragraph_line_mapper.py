"""Build an authoritative docx-paragraph → markdown-line-range map.

The approach avoids fuzzy matching entirely: we inject a unique sentinel at the
start of every non-empty body paragraph, run the docx through markitdown, and
read the sentinel positions out of the resulting markdown. Because the sentinels
survive the docx → HTML → markdown pipeline as inline text and do not change the
line count, the resulting line numbers are identical to those of the original
markdown that issues were indexed against.

Drawings are rasterized first, exactly like the main conversion: rendered
charts occupy markdown lines, so skipping that step here would shift every
line number after the first chart.
