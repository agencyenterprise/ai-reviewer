"""Persistence for images extracted from uploaded documents.

Extracted images live in the ``files`` table like every other on-disk binary,
under role EXTRACTED_IMAGE with ``parent_file_id`` pointing at the document
they came from. They are served by the regular file-download endpoint and are
deleted with their parent (FK cascade for the rows, ``delete_project_files``
for the disk files).

    files go too when nothing references them anymore — cleanup discovers
    disk files only through rows, so skipping this would strand them forever
