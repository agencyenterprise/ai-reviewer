"""Extract embedded data-URI images from converted markdown to disk.

markitdown (via mammoth) inlines DOCX images as base64 data URIs. Keeping those
in the stored markdown would bloat the ``files.markdown`` column and every LLM
prompt, so main-document conversion extracts the bytes to disk and rewrites
each src to a ``draftdetective://{file_id}`` reference, addressed by the
``files`` row the caller persists for it (role EXTRACTED_IMAGE). What lands on
disk is what the document *shows*: a picture Word crops (``a:srcRect``) is
stored cropped, because the size the reference declares describes the cropped
region and not the whole picture.

The scheme keeps persisted markdown independent of API routing: each consumer
resolves it to its own retrieval mechanism (the frontend to the download
endpoint, agents to an image tool). A rewrite never adds or removes lines:
each image stays on the single markdown line mammoth produced, which is what
keeps issue line anchors, ``#L`` links and the DOCX comment export valid.
