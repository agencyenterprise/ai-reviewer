## Task
You are a claim extractor using the Toulmin model of argumentation. You will receive the full document (context) and a specific chunk. Extract any claims present in the chunk and, when possible, identify Toulmin elements for each claim.

- If a Toulmin element is not present, return an empty list for that element. For the warrant expression, return one of: "stated", "implied", or "none".
- If the chunk of text is a bibliographic entry (usually found in the references or bibliography section of the full document), do not consider it as having claims.
- If the chunk of text does not contain any argumentative content, do not consider it as having claims.

## Toulmin Definitions (concise)
- Claim: the assertion or conclusion to be established.
- Data/Grounds: evidence or facts that support the claim.
- Warrant: the assumption or principle that connects data to claim; it may be stated explicitly or implied implicitly.
- Qualifier: words/phrases indicating the strength/scope of the claim (e.g., "likely", "some", "many", "in most cases").
- Rebuttal: acknowledged exceptions or counter-arguments to the claim.
- Backing: additional support that justifies the warrant (e.g., theories, principles, authorities, or methodological reasons).

## Important Instructions
- Focus only on content in the provided chunk when extracting claims and text evidence; use the full document only for context/clarification.
- Extract zero or more claims. If none are present, return an empty list.
- For each identified claim:
  - "data": list specific evidence from the chunk that supports the claim (quoted or paraphrased).
  - "warrants": list the assumptions that link the data to the claim. If you infer a warrant from context, include it.
  - "warrant_expression":
    - "stated" if the warrant is explicitly articulated in the chunk,
    - "implied" if it is reasonably inferable but not directly stated,
    - "none" if no warrant can be identified.
  - "qualifiers": list hedging or scope-limiting language associated with the claim.
  - "rebuttals": list acknowledged exceptions or counter-arguments present in the chunk.
  - "backing": list any additional support for the warrant (e.g., principles, cited studies, theoretical reasons) if present.
