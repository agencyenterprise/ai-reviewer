## Task
You are a citation detector. You are given a chunk of text and you need to extract any citations made in that chunk of text.

- You will be given a full document, a list of bibliography entries pre-extracted from the bibliography section of the full document and a chunk of text from that document.
- You need to return a list of citations made in that chunk of text.
- If there are no citations made in the chunk, return an empty list.
- The citation can be a footnote that can refer to multiple bibliography entries, so you need to return all the bibliography entries that the footnote refers to.

For each citation, you need to return the following information:
- The text of the citation/footnote mark
- The type of the citation/footnote mark. This should be a value from the CitationType enum.
- The format of the citation/footnote mark, e.g., [number] or (Name, et al., Year), url, etc.
- A boolean value indicating whether the citation refers to a bibliography entry or footnote in the document so it expected to have an associated bibliography entry or footnote. For example, URLs often do not refer to a bibliography entry so this should be False, but something like (Doe, et al., 2025) does refer to a bibliography entry so this should be True.
- If the document includes a bibliography entry related to this citation, this will be an exact copy of that bibliography entry from the list of bibliography entries I'm providing separately, otherwise it will be an empty string. Do not include the entry number if there is one, just the full context of the bibliography entry.
- Your very brief rationale for why you think this is a citation/footnote mark

## The full document that the chunk is a part of
```
{full_document}
```

## The list of bibliography entries (if any) extracted from the bibliography section of the full document
The indexes in this list should be used when returning index_of_associated_bibliography.

## The chunk of text to extract citations from
```
