# Some statistics about the office of the US president
Over the course of the US history, the office of the US president has changed hand dozens of times. Various types of exchanges has happened, ranging from the same president being elected more than twice (i.e., Franklin D. Roosevelt) to the president being removed from office (i.e., Andrew Johnson).

One thing that has never happened, is that a one-term president comes back to office in a later term after losing one reelection bid. So surely, based on this track record alone it seems exceedingly unlikely that former president Trump would be able to defeat President Joe Biden in the 2024 election.
