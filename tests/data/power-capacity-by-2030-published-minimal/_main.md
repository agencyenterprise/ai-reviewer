Assessing the United States' Net Additional AI Power Capacity by 2030

Estimating short-term increases in electricity generation and the ability to meet growth in power demand

[...]

# Chapter 1. Introduction

Anticipated growth in artificial intelligence (AI) development requires the buildout of additional power capacity at an exceptional scale and speed. There is concern that the necessary grid loads to power future AI data centers for training and inference activities may exceed the capacity of additions to the U.S. power grid.[[18]](#footnote-18) In this report, we assess potential increases in supply resources in the contiguous United States and propose a capacity metric that can be directly compared with load increases. We address the following question: What will the United States’ additional power capacity be by 2030?

## Background and Motivation

The anticipated load growth from AI is extraordinary in magnitude, speed, and geographic concentration. Developing advanced AI models requires enormous amounts of power,[[19]](#footnote-19) and existing facilities are already straining the U.S. electricity grids.[[20]](#footnote-20) As the demand for computational resources continues to rise in the coming years, electricity consumption by AI data centers is expected to grow at an exceptional rate.[[21]](#footnote-21) Estimates for data center demand growth in the United States by 2030 vary widely, from an additional 34 gigawatts (GW) to as much as 253 GW. This variability stems from significant uncertainties, including the pace of the growth in demand, potential efficiency improvements through innovation, and the unclear long-term expansion plans of data center operators. Differences in reporting units (e.g., terawatt-hours [TWh] versus GW), scope (AI-specific versus general data center demand), and projection timelines further contribute to the range of estimates:

- RAND projects that global AI data center power demand could reach 327 GW by 2030.[[22]](#footnote-22) For the United States alone, additional demand is estimated to be between 158 GW and 253 GW, assuming a retention rate of 50 percent to 80 percent.
- Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) estimates that total U.S. data center power demand—including both AI-related and general use—will range between 325 TWh and 580 TWh by 2028.[[23]](#footnote-23) This estimate corresponds to 74–132 GW, representing an increase of 34–92 GW over current levels.[[24]](#footnote-24)
- Goldman Sachs forecasts an incremental 47 GW of data center demand, including both AI and non-AI uses, by 2030.[[25]](#footnote-25)
