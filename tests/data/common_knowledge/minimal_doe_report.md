U.S. Department of Energy: Secretary of Energy Advisory Board
"Recommendations on Powering Artificial Intelligence and Data Center Infrastructure"
July 30, 2024

## Executive Summary

Data center power demands are growing rapidly, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the U.S. electricity grid. Hyperscale data center interconnection requests of 300â€“1000 MW are becoming increasingly common, stretching local grid capacity and planning timelines.

## Key Findings

### Growing Power Demands

Expanding AI applications, particularly large language models (LLMs), represent a significant driver of data center energy needs. These applications have "sizeable" energy requirements that exceed traditional computing workloads.

### Grid Reliability Concerns

The rapid growth in data center power demands raises material grid planning and reliability concerns:

1. **Capacity Constraints**: Local utilities face challenges providing sufficient power to hyperscale facilities
2. **Timeline Pressures**: Interconnection timelines stretching beyond typical planning horizons
3. **Infrastructure Limits**: Existing grid infrastructure not designed for concentrated loads of this magnitude

### AI-Specific Considerations

Large language model training and inference workloads exhibit particularly high power densities compared to traditional data center operations. The concentrated nature of these loads poses unique challenges for grid planners and operators.

## Recommendations

The Board identifies AI-driven data center demand as a material concern requiring coordinated planning between federal agencies, utilities, and data center operators to ensure adequate power supply and grid reliability through 2030 and beyond.
