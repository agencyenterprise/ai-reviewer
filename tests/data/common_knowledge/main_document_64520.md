# Chapter 1. Introduction

## Purpose

The anticipated growth in AI development requires the buildout of additional power capacity at an unprecedented scale and speed. There is concern that the necessary grid loads to power future AI data centers for training and inference activities may exceed the capacity of additions to the U.S. power grid.[[1]](#footnote-0), [[2]](#footnote-1), [[3]](#footnote-2) This report assesses potential increases in supply resources in the contiguous United States and proposes a capacity metric that can be directly compared with load increases. We address the question,

*What will be the U.S. net available power capacity by 2030?*

## Background and Motivation

**The anticipated load growth from AI is unprecedented in both magnitude and speed.** Developing advanced AI models requires enormous amounts of power[[4]](#footnote-3) and existing facilities are already straining the U.S. electricity grids.[[5]](#footnote-4) As the demand for computational resources continues to rise, electricity consumption by AI data centers is expected to grow at an unprecedented rate in the coming years.[[6]](#footnote-5) Based on current trends for data center power consumption, estimates for AI load growth include 63 GW by 2028,[[7]](#footnote-6) and range between 47 GW[[8]](#footnote-7) to 171 GW by 2030.[[9]](#footnote-8) Beyond the challenge of aggregated scale, a single site expected to demand a large amount of power also poses issues related to building necessary infrastructure in a timely manner[[10]](#footnote-9) and maintain grid stability.[[11]](#footnote-10) An individual facility may consume up to 5 GW by 2030,[[12]](#footnote-11) a substantial scale comparable to the 2023 net summer generation capacity[[13]](#footnote-12) of a single state such as Idaho (5.4 GW), Maine (5.3 GW), or New Hampshire (4.5 GW).[[14]](#footnote-13)

Large concentrated loads can pose challenges for grid infrastructure and stability. The growth in AI development requires unprecedented power capacity expansion.
