AI, data centers and the coming US power demand surge

Driven by AI, broader demand and a deceleration in the pace of energy efficiency gains, global data center power demand is poised
to more than double by 2030 after being flattish in 2015-20. This growth is the primary catalyst alongside increasing
manufacturing/industrial production and broader electrification trends, to an acceleration in US electricity demand CAGR to 2.4%
through the end of the decade from 0% in the last decade. We believe supporting data center driven load growth will require
investment by Utilities of $50 bn in new power generation capacity. We assume a 60/40 split between gas and renewables, which
we expect to drive ~3.3 bcf/d incremental natural gas demand by 2030. While investor interest in the AI revolution theme is not
new, we believe downstream investment opportunities in utilities, renewable generation and industrials whose investment and
products will be needed to support this growth are underappreciated.

Our views on key questions on the coming data center/AI power surge

How signiﬁcant will the power demand growth from AI/data centers be?
We forecast a 15% CAGR in data center power demand from 2023-2030, driving data
centers to make up 8% of total US power demand by 2030 from about 3% currently.
We now see a 2.4% CAGR in US power demand growth through 2030 from 2022
levels vs. ~0% over the last decade. Of the 2.4%, about 90 bps of that is tied to data
centers.

How much generation and overall capital investment will be required to
support data center power demand growth?
We estimate about 47 GW of incremental power generation capacity will be required
to support US data center power demand growth cumulatively through 2030, met with
about 60% gas and 40% renewable sources. We expect this to drive about $50 bn of
capital investment in US power generation capacity cumulatively through 2030.

Will there be bottlenecks in generation or transmission/interconnection
that constrain growth?
Initial conversations with utilities under coverage do not suggest material concerns on

supply chain on the generation kit or transmission side over the current ﬁve-year

planning period, though there have been concerns from investors that issues around
solar in recent years could reemerge. Further, lengthy interconnection queues remain
a challenge to connecting new projects to the grid, and expediting the
permitting/approval process for transmission projects will be key to alleviate it.

Elsewhere, we see similar potential growth constraints from natural gas transmission

infrastructure construction, speciﬁcally long-dated timelines, permitting challenges, and
environmental / landowner litigation. In our view, the most top of mind constraint for
natural gas is construction and permitting timelines where we see an average lag of
~4 years from the project announcement date to in-service date which means the

earliest capacity additions, if announced today, would not be in-service until ~2028.

If not, what will be the constraint to growth: AI budgets, demand or
neither?
The answer to this will be critical to the trajectory for AI power demand. The lack of any

constraint would be the most bullish for power consumption — i.e., if corporate

technology spending budgets are unlimited, then server shipments would remain

otherwise unchanged even as new generations of chips/servers come available that

cost more money but provide greater compute speed/consume more power (with

efﬁciencies). Demand as the constraint would be the most bearish, as, all else equal,
fewer more efﬁcient servers would be able to meet a ﬁxed level of demand. Our
estimates imply budgets are a constraint, i.e., buyers shift towards more productive
products within their budgets.

Finding the downstream beneﬁciaries of AI and data center growth in the
power supply chain

US power demand likely to experience growth not seen in a generation. Not since
the start of the century has US electricity demand grown 2.4% over an eight-year

period, with US annual power generation over the last 20 years averaging less than

0.5% growth. We believe this is on track to change through the end of the decade, led

by a surge in data center demand for power and complemented by electriﬁcation,

industrial reshoring/manufacturing activity. Growth from AI, broader data demand and a

deceleration of power efﬁciency gains is leading to a power surge from data centers,

with data center electricity use expected to more than double by 2030, pushing data

centers to 8% of US power demand vs. 3% in 2022. We believe this is unlocking

underappreciated equity investment opportunities throughout the power supply chain,

and regulated Utilities that will beneﬁt from rate-based growth have continued to trade

more on cyclical factors like interest rates than on the secular generational growth that
is likely to drive earnings. In our report we forecast AI and broader power demand and

highlight 16 Buy-rated stocks across sectors exposed to the US data center power

demand surge.

Where we see opportunity. Investor interest in the data center growth is not new, but
differentiation among enablers, Utility volume growth beneﬁciaries, Utility capex growth

beneﬁciaries and regionalization will likely be the next area of focus. Technology

companies will likely accelerate underwriting power purchase agreements (PPAs),

where the companies sign contracts to buy power from utilities or independent power

producers, for renewable generation. And infrastructure contractors and industrials

making products that support needed transmission, generation and distribution are likely

to beneﬁt.

Potential drivers of upside and downside. A key driver of AI power demand is
whether the constraint to growth is demand, budgets or neither. New generation AI

servers consume more power and provide more compute speed, even as the power

intensity has fallen meaningfully. There could be meaningful upside to our base case if

appetite for purchase and utilization of servers is unconstrained. There could be

downside to our base case if power efﬁciency is higher than expected or if

power/compute speed efﬁciencies lead to fewer servers purchased than expected.

Case study: How Dominion is handling power demand growth from data
centers in Northern Virginia

Northern Virginia has been the data center capital in the US by a fairly signiﬁcant
margin. Northern Virginia currently has more data centers than the next ﬁve biggest

markets in the US combined. The explosive growth of data centers in this region over

the last decade or so was due to a number of factors including low cost of energy on a

relative basis, and state tax incentives for data centers. Although these data centers are

a positive for the local and state economy, they present a signiﬁcant challenge and

opportunity for the local utility Dominion Energy (D, Not Rated). These data centers are

primarily located within Eastern Loudoun County, which is known as “data center alley”,

and having so many energy intensive buildings in one small area can create issues for

the local utility.

D presented PJM with a 15-year forecast for data centers in 2023, which highlighted
the extreme growth that it has seen in data center alley over the last 7 years. The data

center power demand in D’s service territory grew at a nearly 24% CAGR from

2017-2023, and the forecast it presented implies just under a 10% CAGR going forward.

The lower CAGR is largely due to the larger base, as the average MWs added each year

are higher in 2024-2030 than is previous years. The rise of AI is expected to accelerate

the growth of data centers, and some of D’s latest forecasts have the power demand

from data centers increasing by 109% by 2030. The company has stated that although

the extra load from the data centers is great, commercial margins are relatively low, so

the primary beneﬁt for the utility is the supporting investment into the grid and/or into

generation.

In 2022, management stated that it had transmission constraints that could
impact its ability to provide power to data centers in the coming years.
Transmission projects can take years to permit and build, and thus D temporarily paused

connections for new data centers to assess how to proceed. The company’s concern

was not that existing data centers would not receive power, but that if D does not

proactively address the constraint it would have issues going forward. The issue only

impacted Data Center Alley, and did not impact D’s ability to service the remainder of its

service territory.

The company determined that two 500-KV transmission lines should be sufﬁcient
to relieve the constraint and support the upcoming power demand, but getting two
transmission projects done in short timeline is not a guarantee. D worked with the PJM

Interconnection (“PJM”, regional transmission organization that coordinates the

movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of 13 states and DC, including Virginia)

to expedite the process for these transmission projects, and was successful in doing so.

Management told investors on the 4Q2023 earnings call that one of these transmission

projects was already under construction, and the other is in the regulatory process. They

also stated that one of these projects should be enough to relieve the constraint, and

the pause on accepting new data center connections had ended.

To address long term needs, PJM opened a competitive auction for transmission
projects in that region. Although D was able to reconcile the short term constraints
that data center alley faced, neither the utility nor PJM want to rely on having to

expedite transmission projects to ensure reliability. The end result was $5bn of

transmission projects, split between several notable utilities but with D receiving the

largest portion of the bunch, at ~$2.5 bn. PJM stated that the auction was necessary

not only because of the 7.5 GWs of expected demand from data centers, but also

because of the 11 GWs of generation retirements expected in that region. It also notes

that the majority of the projects utilize existing right of ways, which should reduce cost

and speed up the process. D highlights some of these projects in its 1Q2023 slide deck,

with many being just some form of upgrade to the existing grid. This is expected to

support system needs through 2028, and should provide a solid baseline for any

necessary incremental grid spend for beyond that time period.

Transmission is one of the major bottlenecks for the clean energy transition, and
the addition of data centers and AI could exacerbate this. Not all RTOs (regional
transmission organizations, that oversee/coordinate movement of wholesale electricity

across a certain area) will need the same level of investment as PJM, but we look to the
transmission auction that it held as an example of the potential investment needed for

the transmission grid. If we are to assume that the same cost of $5bn to support 7,500

MWs of demand in PJM applies to other RTOs, our base case data center estimate

would imply that the grid would need $19bn of transmission capex through 2030 to

support growth. Although this is a relatively small portion of industry transmission

spend, this spend will likely be concentrated in speciﬁc regions and therefore could be

impactful for the local utility. This does not include the potential incremental distribution

and generation spend that could be necessary, which again could provide meaningful

upside to utility growth over the long term.

The rapid growth of data centers could pose similar issues for other utilities across the
US without proactive investment. The US power grid is built to maintain some level of

reserve supply in the event of increased demand, but data centers are unusually power

intensive and clusters of these in one region can surpass the reserves available. We

believe that looking how D handled the situation provides useful context for the

potential implications of this trend, and the end result gives us conﬁdence that utilities,

regulators, and RTOs can collaborate to overcome near term challenges. Northern

Virginia remains a unique region due to the incentives that attract data centers, but we

believe other RTOs could require similar transmission auctions to support growth, which

could provide further upside to utility growth going forward.

Data center power demand and the AI catalyst

The combination of AI, ex-AI increases in data demand and a material slowdown

in power efﬁciency gains is making data centers a critical driver of accelerating
global and US electricity demand growth. We assume data center power demand
excluding cryptocurrency will grow by 160% in 2030 vs. 2023 levels (bear/bull range of

80%-240% growth), representing an increase of about 650 TWh by 2030 in our base

case (330/1,000 TWh in our bear/bull cases). Data centers alone will contribute a 0.9%

CAGR to overall US power demand and a 0.3% CAGR to overall global power demand,

in our base case, with a bull case contribution of 1.3%/0.5%. Our base case implies data

center power demand moves from 1%-2% of overall global power demand to 3%-4%

by 2030. The increase in the US is even greater — from 3% to 8%. Our estimates for
overall data center power demand are above IEA forecasts (2026), and our outlook for AI
to represent about 19% of data center power demand in 2028 is above recent corporate

forecast.

Data demand has been growing, but until recently power demand from data
centers was ﬂattish. Between 2015 and 2019, data center workload demand nearly
tripled while data center power demand was relatively ﬂat. There were two main drivers

of this:

1.

Power consumption efﬁciency gains (i.e., pace of lower power intensity) within

28 April 2024

Goldman Sachs

cloud and hyperscale data centers. Annual efﬁciency gains averaged about 15%.

2.

Mix shift towards cloud and hyperscale data centers which have materially lower

power consumption intensity than traditional data centers. By 2020 more than 90%

of data center workload demand was at cloud/hyperscale centers.

We estimate in 2020 data center power demand was about 240 TWh, based on data

from the IEA, Cisco and academic sources.

However, in the last three years, power consumption from data centers has been
on the rise. With much of the mix shift already done, the gains from the shift to
cloud/hyperscale have narrowed. Additionally, we have seen efﬁciency gains appear to

wane within cloud/hyperscale data centers (reported data to calculate efﬁciencies is not

consistently available annually and as such for some historical years are estimated or

implied). The IEA estimates 2022 data center power consumption was about 350 TWh,
excluding contribution from cryptocurrency; all else equal this implies cloud/hyperscale

annual efﬁciency gains decelerated to about 1%-2% in 2020-22.

AI to accelerate power demand growth
We assume power demand from AI rises about 200 TWh in 2024-30 (bear/bull case

of 110-330 TWh), with AI representing about 20% of overall data center power
demand by 2030 in our base case. We see a wide range in our bear/bull scenario
driven by uncertainty over demand and power efﬁciency. As demand for AI training
grows in the medium term and for inference longer term, we see demand growth well

exceeding the efﬁciency improvements that are leading to meaningful reductions in high

power AI server power intensity. We note that a ChatGPT search consumes around

6x-10x the power as a traditional Google search (see Exhibit 11).

We have seen new AI innovations increase computing speed and max power
consumption per server, representing meaningful reduction in power intensity. As
demand for GPUs grows, there is still notable company-projected intensity reductions.

As an example of how innovations have reduced power intensity per server but

increased overall power per server:

max, or 1.30 kW per pFLOPS.

2024-26, representing a 50% CAGR in server revenues; whether demand, budgets
or neither is the constraint to growth is critical for energy use forecasting. A key
question impacting compute demand is whether that demand is pent-up (i.e., available

new servers will be bought regardless of budget), not pent-up and constrained by

demand itself, or constrained by customer budgets. In other words, will customers buy

equal amounts of the more powerful servers as they would the less powerful ones? If in

a scenario in which a customer initially desires to buy 10 AI servers, and a new

generation is announced with 10x the compute speed for 5x the price, will the

customer:

1.

Buy the same number of servers (10), spend more money (5x) and substantially

increase its compute speed as a result of the innovation (10x)? This would represent

no constraints (i.e., unlimited budgets, so demand dictated by available supply).

2.

Buy 1/10 the number of servers (1), maintaining the same level of compute power

as prior to the innovation and spending less money (0.5x)? This would represent

demand as the constraint.

3.

Buy 1/5 the number of servers (2), thereby maintaining budget allocated for server

purchases but getting a greater compute speed (2x)? This would represent budget

as the constraint.

Conﬁdence in the above question is key to whether forecasting methodology should
be weighted towards server-based (requiring nuance given varied and dynamic power

consumption intensity and compute intensity) vs. demand based (forecasting compute

power and power intensity per unit of compute power).

We have applied both a server supply driven forecast and a compute speed
demand driven forecast, with a heavier weight applied towards the supply-driven
methodology.

On the server supply-driven side, we apply our global Technology team’s forecast
for server shipments per year mentioned above, divided among high energy vs. low

energy servers. We assume server replacement every 5 years. Our TMT team sees

a sharp increase in high power servers (greater electricity consumption per server,

higher ASP) increasing sharply in the next few years to meet demand for AI training,

while the team sees greater weighting of growth from lower power servers (lower

electricity consumption per server, lower ASP) towards the back of the decade as AI

demand weighting shifts more towards inference. We assume 5%-8% annual power

efﬁciency gains per year to reﬂect expected future server innovation — relative to

demand-based energy intensities where saw higher annual efﬁciencies early in life
cycle, we assume slower pace in a supply-based approach to reﬂect timing of

adoption. The result is falling power intensity per computing speed and sharp

increases in overall power demand due to the growth in new servers with higher

weighting within higher power servers towards the newer generation that as

mentioned have lower power intensity but higher power consumption per server.

n

On the demand-driven side, we use our China Media, Internet & Telecom team’s AI
compute power forecast to drive global AI compute demand outlook. We assume
power efﬁciency gains of 8%-15% annually in our base case through the end of the

decade — this reﬂects similar efﬁciency gains as seen ex-AI in 2015-20.

Together, this implies sharp increase in electricity use from AI, even as revenues
from servers shipped are implied ﬂattish in 2027-30. Our global TMT team’s server
shipment and ASP forecasts imply ﬂattish revenues in 2027-30, driven by greater

weighting towards lower power we see a greater mix shift towards lower cost lower

power servers within the mix, in addition to expectations for ASP declines. However,

with the mix shift and ASP reductions offset by increased volumes — and with the

overall number of servers in operation continuing to grow, we see sharp demand growth

from AI for electricity even despite expected efﬁciencies, owing to a combination of

maturity and expected overlap with demand via AI. Based on the framework and

assumptions described above, we see AI power demand moving up by around 200 TWh

in 2030 vs. 2023.

Data center power demand ex-AI
We expect continued strong growth in workload unrelated to AI. We assume
double digit growth in workload compute instances with deceleration from the

20%-25% of compute instances growth seen since 2017 down to 12%-18% annual

growth in 2026-30, owing to combination of maturity and expected overlap with demand

via AI. A key question on ex-AI demand is whether AI modeling and user demand for AI

will partially replace users’ need for searches or other workload. We are broadly

assuming minimal replacement — i.e., AI is largely incremental to the broader trend of

data center workload demand.

Power intensity efﬁciency gains among cloud/hyperscale data centers have
decelerated; we assume modest re-acceleration in our base case. We assume
power efﬁciency gains — which as mentioned averaged around 15% annually in 2015-19

but decelerated to around low single digits in 2020-22 — will remain relatively low.
However, we assume a slight re-acceleration to an average of 3% in our base case in
2024-30, as industry discussions suggest continued efforts towards innovation
efﬁciencies, especially around the power intensity given the prospects for signiﬁcant

power needs ahead.

The implications of the efﬁciency gains assumption leads to a wide range
between our bear and bull cases for ex-AI data center demand growth. Based on
the above framework and assumptions, we see about 450 TWh of ex-AI power demand

growth in 2030 vs 2023 in our base case vs. 225/650 TWh in our bear/bull cases. As we

have highlighted earlier, we believe the efﬁciency assumption is a critical driver of power

demand outlook ex-AI — our bear/bull cases assume 7%/0% annual intensity reductions

on average in 2024-30.

US power demand growth expanding to levels not seen in decades

Over the last ten years, power demand growth in the US has averaged ~0%.
Despite economic and population growth over that time period, efﬁciencies have offset

this, with advances like the penetration of LED lighting driving lower power usage. As

mentioned above, power consumption efﬁciency of data centers and the mix shift to

cloud and hyperscale data centers from traditional data centers have also contributed to

these efﬁciencies. With that said, we expect power demand to accelerate to levels not

seen in the US in many years.

With this note, we raise our US power demand forecast to 5,036 TWh by 2030,
which represents a 2.4% CAGR from 2022-2030. This compares to our prior estimates
of 4,733 TWh demand by 2030 and a 1.7% CAGR from 2022-2030. The driver of this

change is embedding explicit assumptions around data center and AI growth. We

continue to forecast residential, commercial ex-data center, and industrial demand using
historical relationships to macroeconomic factors, and embed a separate forecast for
electric vehicles based on our colleagues’ EV outlook.

Exhibit 17: US power demand growth has averaged 0% in the last

On our updated estimates, we expect data centers to contribute 8% to overall US
power demand by 2030 in our base case, from current levels estimated at ~3%. This
translates to a 16% CAGR for data centers in our base case from 2023-2030, and

contributes about 90 bps to our overall power demand CAGR over the same time frame.

We believe this will drive a need for incremental generation capacity to be built in the
US, which we believe in part has been signaled by sizable IRP ﬁlings in recent years

from several companies that have increased load growth forecasts/generation needs, as

well as RTOs that have revised load growth assumptions higher.

In order to size the generation capacity potential, we have considered expected
regional allocation of data centers, current and future states of reserve margins in

different regions across the US according to NERC, and assumptions around natural gas

vs. renewables and peakers vs. combined cycle gas plants based on recent IRP ﬁlings.

In order to support data center/AI driven load growth, we assume capacity is met with

60% gas (40% CCGT/20% peaking units) and 40% renewables (25% solar, 15% wind).

This adds 47 GW of capacity cumulatively from 2024-2030, including 28 GW of gas and

19 GW of renewables. This embeds ~9 GW of combined cycle and ~19 GW of peakers,

in addition to ~13 GW of solar and ~6 GW of wind. This points to average annual

capacity additions through 2030 of ~1.3 GW for CCGT, ~2.7 GW for gas peaking units,

0.9 GW for wind, and ~1.9 GW for solar. Overall, our power supply/demand model now

embeds ~45 GW annual net capacity additions on average through 2030, including

non-data center driven adds.

While we do not explicitly assume any nuclear capacity is added through the extent of

our model (through 2030), we believe (1) we will see fewer nuclear plant closures going
forward, which could present upside risk to nuclear generation as more plants receive

license extensions, as well as uranium demand, (2) nuclear is an attractive generation

source for data centers given it is zero carbon and reliable, but we view IPPs with

nuclear capacity as best positioned to beneﬁt versus regulated utilities, and (3) small

modular reactors (SMRs) could have a more impactful role in the future, but we view

that as beyond the life of our current model.

Consistent with our LCOE model, we assume capital costs to build this generation
capacity is $1,000/kW for CCGTs, $750/kW for gas peakers, $1,600/kW for onshore

wind, and $1,300/kW for utility scale solar. This drives incremental capital investments

of ~$50 bn cumulatively through 2030, or $7 bn on average per year to support data

center growth. Combining data center related power generation capacity needs with our

baseline capacity addition forecasts to support load growth in other areas as well as

offset retirements of coal units drives total generation capex of $665 bn cumulatively

through 2030, or ~$95 bn on average annually through 2030.

While we recognize that $50 bn industry wide spend through 2030 could be digestible,

we believe spend will be regionally concentrated, particularly in MISO, which could be
more meaningful for companies exposed to MISO. We also believe this is just one piece

of the overall utilities capex opportunity pie. We see investment needed for further

generation capex to support the energy transition, load growth outside of data centers,

as well as needs to support grid reliability. We also note that assumptions around

We have not seen signiﬁcant stock price movement for regulated utilities on this
theme, despite the fact that we have seen strong stock price performance for select
independent power producers (IPPs) that are expected to beneﬁt from increased
demand for power and potentially higher power prices going forward. We believe there
are two potential avenues for regulated utilities to beneﬁt from this data center
driven load growth (recognizing this is not the only driver of load growth). First, is the
volumetric beneﬁts from higher commercial load growth for companies that operate in
regions tied to data center growth that are not decoupled. We recognize this is likely
muted given the lower margin nature of commercial sales. Second, is higher rate base
growth via the increased capital investment required to facilitate this growth. This
could come in the form of generation capex, which we quantify for US demand tied to

data centers above, or grid investment to support transmission/reliability needs.

As mentioned above, in addition to incremental power generation needs to support data

center/AI driven load growth, we also expect this load growth to support investment in
grid reliability, in particular for transmission. While there is certainly existing capacity that
can be utilized or enhanced, we continue to believe transmission is an area where

incremental investment is needed. As we have written in our Future of Utilities Capex
series, we expect to see a signiﬁcant step up in capital investment across our coverage
going forward (+36% cumulatively from 2024-2027 vs. prior 4 year period), supporting

~7% earnings growth across our coverage.

distribution. The historical baseline is driven by EEI industry capex estimates, and the

forecast is based on the growth in grid spend we expect for our coverage. We assume

transmission grows at a slight premium to the average, offsetting areas of spend decline

(e.g. regulatory compliance/other), and that distribution grows more in line with the

average. This points to average annual spend through 2030 of ~$66 bn on distribution

and ~$37 bn on transmission. Including the generation spend noted above, the total

capital investment across transmission, distribution, and generation is up ~38% across

2024-2027 relative to the prior four year period, broadly in line with the step up in our

coverage capex outlined above.

Capacity Additions - Gas Demand Growth from Data Centers

We see incremental data center power demand driving ~3.3 bcf/d of new natural
gas demand by 2030. This estimate assumes gas provides ~60% of the ~28.7 GW of

total data center power demand expected through the rest of the decade, and implies
roughly a ~10% increase in the amount of gas consumed in the power market vs.
today. More notably, this represents a ~50% increase vs. our prior growth expectations
for power demand for gas - and adds to the broader constructive backdrop for gas
demand growth alongside new LNG export capacity, coal plant retirements, and
renewables backstopping.

We expect this growth to be relatively ratable (~0.47 bcf/d on average) through
the decade, though this can swing based on price, regional build-out, and
infrastructure delays (we discuss these below). While natural gas currently serves

40% of power demand, and we expect that overall share to hold relatively ﬁrm through
the rest of the decade, we assume a higher share (60% as mentioned above) serving
data center demand growth speciﬁcally given gas’s relatively low cost and high
reliability.  For this estimate, we assume ~40% of this demand is met through CCGTs
with heat rates of 7,000 kWh/btu and ~20% of this demand is met through peakers
with heat rates of 10,000 kWh/btu - a swing more towards the former could reduce

incremental gas demand all else equal. On timing, we would expect the existing ﬂeet to

pull more gas in nearer years and then new plants - via new pipelines (see below) -

would serve new demand in later years. .

For context, the US gas market for power sits at roughly ~35 bcf/d and makes up

roughly a third of the total gas market of ~100 bcf/d - making this a notable, but
not yet revolutionary, change in the outlook. Looking forward, we expect natural gas
for power demand to grow ~3% annually, of which, data centers make up a meaningful

portion of that growth (~40%). Versus the market size today, our estimate of an

incremental ~3.3 bcf/d of gas demand growth from data centers represents a ~10%

increase in the amount of gas consumed in the power market. For context, this

compares to the gas market for LNG exports which currently sits at ~12 bcf/d and is set

to nearly double to ~25 bcf/d by the end of the decade based on currently FID’ed

projects - and the ResComm and industrial demand of 21 bcf/d and 23 bcf/d,

respectively. All else equal, while we see the potential for data center driven power

demand to accelerate gas demand for power growth generally, and it could represent a

meaningful slice of the pie by the end of the decade, we see the potential magnitude for

growth on a smaller scale than the ramp of LNG set for the second half of the decade.

We believe this growth could require the construction of ~6.1 bcf/d of new
pipeline capacity. Taking the Utilities team’s forecast that roughly half of overall new
data center demand requires new powergen capacity (~14.2 GW out of the 28.7 total)

with the balance being able to be served by existing facilities, we assume that only the

former needs incremental pipeline build-out.  Given our assumed capacity factors for

CCGT and peakers ~60% and 15%, respectively on average, the required pipeline

capacity to generate the ~3.3 bcf/d of physical demand by 2030 could be ~6.1 bcf/d if

contracted out to 100%.  While this may not be required in all cases, contracts for new

capacity are now often sized to be able to accommodate peak load - this has been a

consistent message from management teams in the sector, most notably by WMB at

their 2024 Analyst Day. A qualiﬁer to this view includes the potential for data centers to

connect directly to gas transmission systems as discussed recently by KMI on its 1Q24

call and WMB at its Analyst Day. Direct connectivity could result in lower pipeline

capacity requirements given likely higher average utilizations at data centers vs average

gas-ﬁred power plants – though, these types of projects could be lower capex and/or

higher return, mostly offsetting this impact in our view. As mentioned, our estimate

assumes roughly an equal mix between higher ﬂows on existing assets and new

pipeline construction to accommodate new ﬂows; tighter than expected utilization on

the former could drive the investment requirements for the latter higher. We discuss

upside scenarios below.

We acknowledge the range of outcomes is wide and potential gas and pipeline

capacity demand growth is still being determined - and we highlight potential
upside cases below. While we see recent commentary from both midstream and E&P
companies on the prospect for natural gas to serve signiﬁcant data center power

demand growth as positive for the gas macro backdrop generally, the magnitude of

demand and how that can manifest on a micro level for each company is still being

determined.

We provide two bull case scenarios to illustrate potential upside to our physical
gas and gas pipeline capacity demand estimates - there could be up to ~5.5 bcf/
d of natural gas demand and up to 20.5 bcf/d of gas pipeline capacity demand by

2030:

n

Base Case: As described above, our base case assumes that by 2030, 3.3 bcf/d of
gas could be needed to serve ~60% of the ~28.7 GW of total data center power

demand, with the remaining 40% served by renewables. Our incremental pipeline

capacity estimate of ~6.1 bcf/d assumes roughly half of overall new data center

demand requires new powergen capacity (~14.2 GW out of the 28.7 total) with the

balance being able to be served by existing facilities - we assume that only the

former needs incremental pipeline build-out.  Given our assumed capacity factors for

CCGT and peakers ~60% and 15%, respectively on average, the required pipeline
capacity to generate the ~3.3 bcf/d of physical demand by 2030 could be ~6.1 bcf/d

if contracted out to 100%.

n

Bull Case 1: Our ﬁrst bull case assumes that incremental pipeline capacity could be
required for all incremental gas-ﬁred powergen demand (i.e. 60% of total 28.7 GW,

not just new powergen capacity as we assume in our base case). Assuming pipeline

capacity is contracted to peak plant capacity, this could result in pipeline capacity
needs of ~12.3 bcf/d and ~$15b of transmission capex. By 2030, this scenario could

add up to ~$1.7b-$2.5b of annual incremental EBITDA to the midstream sector.

n

Bull Case 2: Our second bull case assumes that instead of gas/renewables serving
60%/40% of incremental data center powergen demand, gas will serve 100%. We
maintain our heat rate and capacity factor assumptions embedded in our base case

as well as the proportion of new powergen capacity that will be supplied by CCGT

(~67%) and peakers (~33%). Our second bull case assumes that 100% of data

center power demand requires new pipeline capacity (~28.7 GW total). This could

result in ~5.5 bcf/d of incremental physical gas demand, and assuming pipeline

capacity is contracted to peak plant capacity, this could result in ~20.5 bcf/d of gas

pipeline capacity needs. On capex, 20.5 bcf/d of pipeline capacity could require

$24.9b of transmission capex by 2030 - this could add ~$2.8b-$4.1b of annual

incremental EBITDA for the midstream sector.

GS Factor Proﬁle
The Goldman Sachs Factor Proﬁle provides investment context for a stock by comparing key attributes to the market (i.e. our coverage universe) and its
sector peers. The four key attributes depicted are: Growth, Financial Returns, Multiple (e.g. valuation) and Integrated (a composite of Growth, Financial
Returns and Multiple). Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for speciﬁc metrics for each stock. The
normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute. The precise calculation of each metric may
vary depending on the ﬁscal year, industry and region, but the standard approach is as follows:

Growth is based on a stock’s forward-looking sales growth, EBITDA growth and EPS growth (for ﬁnancial stocks, only EPS and sales growth), with a
higher percentile indicating a higher growth company. Financial Returns is based on a stock’s forward-looking ROE, ROCE and CROCI (for ﬁnancial
stocks, only ROE), with a higher percentile indicating a company with higher ﬁnancial returns. Multiple is based on a stock’s forward-looking P/E, P/B,
price/dividend (P/D), EV/EBITDA, EV/FCF and EV/Debt Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF) (for ﬁnancial stocks, only P/E, P/B and P/D), with a higher percentile
indicating a stock trading at a higher multiple. The Integrated percentile is calculated as the average of the Growth percentile, Financial Returns
percentile and (100% - Multiple percentile).

Financial Returns and Multiple use the Goldman Sachs analyst forecasts at the ﬁscal year-end at least three quarters in the future. Growth uses inputs
for the ﬁscal year at least seven quarters in the future compared with the year at least three quarters in the future (on a per-share basis for all metrics).

For a more detailed description of how we calculate the GS Factor Proﬁle, please contact your GS representative.

M&A Rank
Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary
across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring
companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2
representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard
departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not
factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.

Ratings, coverage universe and related deﬁnitions
Buy (B), Neutral (N), Sell (S) Analysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy or
Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock’s total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on
an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a  stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed
Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region’s Investment lists and
represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their
respective areas of coverage.  The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other
designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts’ investment rating for such stocks.

Total return potential represents the upside or downside differential between the current share price and the price target, including all paid or
anticipated dividends, expected during the time horizon associated with the price target. Price targets are required for all covered stocks. The total
return potential, price target and associated time horizon are stated in each report adding or reiterating an Investment List membership.

Coverage Universe: A list of all stocks in each coverage universe is available by primary analyst, stock and coverage universe at
https://www.gs.com/research/hedge.html.

Not Rated (NR). The investment rating, target price and earnings estimates (where relevant) are not provided or have been suspended pursuant to
Goldman Sachs policy when Goldman Sachs is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or in a strategic transaction involving this company, when

target for this stock, because there is not a sufﬁcient fundamental basis for determining an investment rating or target price. The previous investment
rating and target price, if any, are no longer in effect for this stock and should not be relied upon.  Coverage Suspended (CS). Goldman Sachs has
suspended coverage of this company.  Not Covered (NC). Goldman Sachs does not cover this company.  Not Available or Not Applicable (NA). The
information is not available for display or is not applicable.  Not Meaningful (NM). The information is not meaningful and is therefore excluded.

of reports are published at irregular intervals as appropriate in the analyst’s judgment.

The analysts named in this report may have from time to time discussed with our clients, including Goldman Sachs salespersons and traders, or may
discuss in this report, trading strategies that reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term impact on the market price of the equity securities
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analyst’s published price target expectations for such stocks. Any such

potential relative to its coverage universe as described herein.

We and our afﬁliates, ofﬁcers, directors, and employees will from time to time have long or short positions in, act as principal in, and buy or sell, the
securities or derivatives, if any, referred to in this research, unless otherwise prohibited by regulation or Goldman Sachs policy.
