Preface
Electricity is a key component of the fabric of modern society and the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) Enterprise serves to strengthen that fabric. The vision for the ERO Enterprise, which is comprised of
NERC and the six Regional Entities, is a highly reliable, resilient, and secure North American bulk power system (BPS). Our mission is to assure the effective and efficient reduction of risks to the reliability and
security of the grid.

Reliability | Resilience | Security
Because nearly 400 million citizens in North America are counting on us

The North American BPS is made up of six Regional Entities as shown on the map and in the corresponding table below. The multicolored area denotes overlap as some load-serving entities participate in one
Regional Entity while associated Transmission Owners/Operators participate in another.

About This Assessment
NERC is a not-for-profit international regulatory authority with the mission to assure the reliability of
the  BPS  in  North  America.  NERC  develops  and  enforces  Reliability  Standards;  annually  assesses
seasonal and long-term reliability; monitors the BPS through system awareness; and educates, trains,
and certifies industry personnel. NERC’s area of responsibility spans the continental United States,
Canada, and the northern portion of Baja California, Mexico. NERC is the ERO for North America and
is subject to oversight by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC, also known as the
Commission) and governmental authorities in Canada. NERC’s jurisdiction includes users, owners, and
operators of the North American BPS and serves more than 334 million people. Section 39.11(b) of
FERC’s regulations provides that “The Electric Reliability Organization shall conduct assessments of
the adequacy of the Bulk-Power System in North America and report its findings to the Commission,
the  Secretary  of  Energy,  each  Regional  Entity,  and  each  Regional  Advisory  Body  annually  or  more
frequently if so ordered by the Commission.”

Development Process
This assessment was developed based on data and narrative information NERC collected from the six
Regional Entities (see Preface) on an assessment area basis (see Regional Assessments Dashboards)
to  independently  evaluate  the  long-term  reliability  of  the  North  American  BPS  while  identifying
trends,  emerging  issues,  and  potential  risks  during  the  upcoming  10-year  assessment  period.  The
Reliability  Assessment  Subcommittee  (RAS),  at  the  direction  of  NERC’s  Reliability  and  Security
Technical  Committee  (RSTC),  supported  the  development  of  this  assessment  through  a
comprehensive and transparent peer-review process that leverages the knowledge and experience of
system  planners,  RAS  members,  NERC  staff,  and  other  subject  matter  experts;  this  peer-review
process ensures the accuracy and completeness of all data and information. This assessment was also
reviewed by the RSTC, and the NERC Board of Trustees subsequently accepted this assessment and
endorsed the key findings.

NERC develops the Long-Term Reliability Assessment (LTRA) annually in accordance with the ERO’s
Rules of Procedure1 and Title 18, § 39.112 of the Code of Federal Regulations;3 this is also required by
Section 215(g) of the Federal Power Act, which instructs NERC to conduct periodic assessments of the
North American BPS.4

Considerations
This  assessment  was  developed  by  using  a  consistent  approach  for  projecting  future  resource
adequacy  through  the  application  of  the  ERO  Reliability  Assessment  Process.5  Projections  in  this
assessment are not predictions of what will happen; they are based on information supplied in July
2024 about known system changes with updates incorporated prior to publication. This 2024 LTRA
assessment period includes projections for 2025–2034; however, some figures and tables examine
data and information for the 2024 year. NERC’s standardized data reporting and instructions were
developed  through  stakeholder  processes  to  promote  data  consistency  across  all  the  reporting
entities that are further explained in the Demand Assumptions and Resource Categories section of
this  report.  Reliability  impacts  related  to  cyber  and  physical  security  risks  are  not  specifically
addressed in this assessment; it is primarily focused on resource adequacy and operating reliability.
NERC  leads  a  multi-faceted  approach  through  NERC’s  Electricity  Information  Sharing  and  Analysis
Center  (E-ISAC)  to  promote  mechanisms  to  address  physical  and  cyber  security  risks,  including
exercises and information-sharing efforts with the electric industry.

The LTRA data used for this assessment creates a reference case dataset that includes projected on-
peak demand and system energy needs, demand response (DR), resource capacity, and transmission
projects.  Data  from  each  Regional  Entity  is  also  collected  and  used  to  identify  notable  trends  and
emerging  issues.  This  bottom-up  approach  captures  virtually  all  electricity  supplied  in  the  United
States, Canada, and a portion of Baja California, Mexico. NERC’s reliability assessments are developed
to inform industry, policymakers, and  regulators as well as to aid  NERC in achieving its mission to
ensure the reliability of the North American BPS.

1 NERC Rules of Procedure - Section 803
2 Section 39.11(b) of FERC’s regulations states the following: “The Electric Reliability Organization shall conduct assessments of the adequacy of the Bulk-Power System in North America and report its findings to the Commission, the Secretary of Energy, each
Regional Entity, and each Regional Advisory Body annually or more frequently if so ordered by the Commission.”
3 Title 18, § 39.11 of the Code of Federal Regulations
4 BPS reliability, as defined in the How NERC Defines BPS Reliability section of this report, does not include the reliability of the lower-voltage distribution systems that account for 80% of all electricity supply interruptions to end-use customers.

About This Assessment

Assumptions
In  this  2024  LTRA,  the  baseline  information  on  future  electricity  supply  and  demand  is  based  on
several assumptions:6

•  Supply and demand projections are based on industry forecasts submitted and validated in
July  2024.  Any  subsequent  demand  forecast  or  resource  plan  changes  may  not  be  fully
represented; however, updated data submitted throughout the report drafting time frame
have been included where appropriate.

•  Peak demand is based on average peak weather conditions and assumed forecast economic
activity at the time of submittal. Weather variability is discussed in each Regional Entity’s self-
assessment.

Reading this Report
This report is compiled into two major parts:

1.  A reliability assessment of the North American BPS with the following goals:

a.  Evaluate  industry  preparations  that  are  in  place  to  meet  projections  and  maintain

reliability

b.

Identify trends in demand, supply, reserve margins, and probabilistic resource adequacy
metrics

c.

Identify emerging reliability issues

d.  Focus  the  industry,  policymakers,  and  the  general  public’s  attention  on  BPS  reliability

•  Generation and transmission equipment will perform at historical availability levels.

issues

•  Future  generation  and  transmission  facilities  are  commissioned  and  in  service  as  planned,

planned outages take place as scheduled, and retirements take place as proposed.

e.  Make recommendations based on an independent NERC reliability assessment process

2.  A regional reliability assessment that contains the following:

•  Demand reductions expected from dispatchable and controllable DR programs will yield the

a.  A 10-year data dashboard

forecast results if they are called on.

•  Other  peak  demand-side  management  programs,  such  as  energy  efficiency  (EE)  and  price-

responsive DR, are reflected in the forecasts of total internal demand.

b.  Summary assessments for each assessment area

c.  A focus on specific issues identified through industry data and emerging issues

d.  A description of regional planning processes and methods used to ensure reliability

6 Forecasts cannot precisely predict the future. Instead, many forecasts report probabilities with a range of possible outcomes. For example, each regional demand projection is assumed to represent the expected midpoint of possible future outcomes. This
means that a future year’s actual demand may deviate from the projection due to the inherent variability of the key factors that drive electrical use, such as weather. In the case of the NERC regional projections, there is a 50% probability that actual
demand will be higher than the forecast midpoint and a 50% probability that it will be lower (50/50 forecast).

Executive Summary
In the 2024 LTRA, NERC finds that most of the North American BPS faces mounting resource adequacy
challenges  over  the  next  10  years  as  surging  demand  growth  continues  and  thermal  generators
announce  plans  for  retirement.  New  solar  PV,  battery,  and  hybrid  resources  continue  to  flood
interconnection  queues,  but  completion  rates  are  lagging  behind  the  need  for  new  generation.
Furthermore,  the  performance  of  these  replacement  resources  is  more  variable  and  weather-
dependent  than  the  generators  they  are  replacing.  As  a  result,  less  overall  capacity  (dispatchable
capacity in particular) is being added to the system than what was projected and needed to meet
future  demand.  The  trends  point  to  critical  reliability  challenges  facing  the  industry:  satisfying
escalating  energy  growth,  managing  generator  retirements,  and  accelerating  resource  and
transmission development.

This 2024 LTRA is the ERO’s independent assessment and comprehensive report on the adequacy of
planned BPS resources to reliably meet the electricity demand across North America over the next 10
years; it also identifies reliability trends, emerging issues, and potential risks that could impact the
long-term  reliability,  resilience,  and  security  of  the  BPS.  The  findings  presented  here  are  vitally
important to understanding the reliability risks to the North American BPS as it is currently planned
and  being  influenced  by  government  policies,  regulations,  consumer  preferences,  and  economic
factors. Summaries of the report sections are provided below.

Capacity and Energy Risk Assessment
The Capacity and Energy Risk Assessment section of this report identifies potential future electricity
supply  shortfalls  under  normal  and  extreme  weather  conditions.  NERC’s  evaluation  of  resource
adequacy in the LTRA considers both the capacity of the resources and the capability of resources to
convert  inputs  (e.g.,  fuel,  wind,  and  solar  irradiance)  into  electrical  energy.  NERC  used  both  a
probabilistic assessment and a reserve margin analysis to assess the risk of future electricity supply
shortfalls. Both are forward-looking snapshots of resource adequacy that are tied to industry forecasts
of electricity supplies, demand, and transmission development.

Areas categorized as High Risk fall below established resource adequacy criteria in the next five years.
High-risk  areas  are  likely  to  experience  a  shortfall  in  electricity  supplies  at  the  peak  of  an  average
summer or winter season. Extreme weather, producing wide-area heat waves or deep-freeze events,
poses an even greater threat to reliability. Elevated-Risk areas meet resource adequacy criteria, but
analysis  indicates  that  extreme  weather  conditions  are  likely  to  cause  a  shortfall  in  area  reserves.
Normal-Risk  areas  are  expected  to  have  sufficient  resources  under  a  broad  range  of  assessed
conditions. The results of the risk assessment are depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Risk Area Summary 2025–2029 (Corrected July 2025)

Regional Assessments Dashboards
The Regional Assessments Dashboards section contains dashboards and summaries for each of the
20 assessment areas, developed from data and narrative information collected by NERC from the six
Regional Entities. Probabilistic Assessments (ProbA) are presented that identify energy risk periods
and describe the contributing demand and resource factors.

Reserve margins fall below RMLs as nuclear units undergo refurbishment and some current resource contracts expire. Demand growth is also
adding to resource procurement needs.
Resource  additions  are  not  keeping  up  with  generator  retirements  and  demand  growth.  Winter  seasons  replace  summer  as  the  higher-risk
periods due to generator performance and fuel supply issues.
Demand growth and planned generator retirements contribute to growing energy risks. Load is at risk in extreme winter conditions that cause
demand to soar while supplies are threatened by generator performance, fuel issues, and inability to obtain emergency transfers.
Surging load growth is driving resource adequacy concerns as the share of dispatchable resources in the mix struggles to keep pace. Extreme
winter weather has the potential to cause the most severe load-loss events.
Demand growth and planned generator retirements can result in supply shortfalls during wide-area heat events that limit the supply of energy
available for import.
Drought and extreme cold temperatures in winter can result in periods of insufficient operating reserves when neighboring areas are unable to
provide excess energy.

Executive Summary

Risk from Additional Generator Retirements
Plans for generator retirements continue at similar pace and scale to levels reported in the 2023 LTRA.
Confirmed generator retirements (52 GW by 2029 and 78 GW over the 10-year period) are accounted
for in the Capacity and Energy Risk Assessment above. Economic, policy, and regulatory factors spur
further fossil-fired generators to retire in the 10-year horizon. Announced retirements, which include
many generators that have not begun formal deactivation processes with planning entities, total 115
GW over the 10-year period. The effect of all retirements on the assessment area Planning Reserve
Margins (PRM) can be seen in Figure 2. On-peak reserve margins fall below RMLs; the levels required
by jurisdictional resource adequacy requirements) in the next 10 years in almost every assessment
area, signaling an accelerating need for more resources.

Figure 2: Projected Reserve Margin Shortfall Areas with Announced Generator
Retirements (Corrected July 2025)

Changing Resource Mix and Reliability Implications
New resource additions continue at a rapid pace. Solar PV remains the overwhelmingly predominant
generation type being added to the BPS followed by battery and hybrid resources, natural-gas-fired
generators, and wind turbines. New resource additions fell short of industry’s projections from the
2023 LTRA with the notable exception of batteries, which added more nameplate capacity than was
reported in development last year.

As  older  fossil-fired  generators  retire  and  are  replaced  by  more  solar  PV  and  wind  resources,  the
resource  mix is becoming increasingly  variable and  weather-dependent. Solar PV, wind, and other
variable  energy  resources  (VER)  contribute  some  fraction  of  their  nameplate  capacity  output  to
serving demand based on the energy-producing inputs (e.g., solar irradiance, wind speed). The new
resources also have different physical and operating characteristics from the generators that they are
replacing,  affecting  the  essential  reliability  services  (ERS)  that  the  resource  mix  provides.  As
generators are deactivated and replaced by new types of resources, ERS must still be maintained for
the grid to operate reliably.

Natural-gas-fired generators are a vital BPS resource. They provide ERSs by ramping up and down to
balance a more variable resource mix and are a dispatchable electricity supply for winter and times
when  wind  and  solar  resources  are  less  capable  of  serving  demand.  Natural  gas  pipeline  capacity
additions  over  the  past  seven  years  are  trending  downward,  and  some  areas  could  experience
insufficient pipeline capacity for electric generation during peak periods.

Trends and Reliability Implications
Demand and transmission trends affect long-term reliability and the sufficiency of electricity supplies.
A  summary  for  each  is  provided  below  and  further  discussed  within  the  Demand  Trends  and
Implications and Transmission Development and Interregional Transfer Capability sections.

Demand Trends
Electricity peak demand and energy growth forecasts over the 10-year assessment period continue to
climb; demand growth is now higher than at any point in the past two decades. Increasing amounts
of large commercial and industrial loads are connecting rapidly to the BPS. The size and speed with
which  data  centers  (including  crypto  and  AI)  can  be  constructed  and  connect  to  the  grid  presents
unique  challenges  for  demand  forecasting  and  planning  for  system  behavior.  Additionally,  the
continued adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps is a substantial driver for demand around
North  America.  The  aggregated  BPS-wide  projections  for  both  winter  and  summer  have  increased
massively over the 10-year period:

Executive Summary

The  ITCS  provides  foundational  insights  that  facilitate  stakeholder  analysis  and  actions;  it  is  not  a
transmission plan. In the future, NERC will extend the study beyond the congressional mandate to
include transfer capabilities from the United States to Canada and among Canadian provinces.

Emerging Issues
The  Emerging  Issues  section  discusses  developments  and  trends  that  have  the  potential  to
substantially  change  future  long-term  demand  and  resource  projections,  resource  availability,  and
reliable operations of the BPS. Topics include data centers and large industrial loads, battery energy
storage systems, electric vehicles and load, and energy drought. NERC’s RSTC has formed new task
forces where needed to address emerging issues.

•  The aggregated assessment area summer peak demand forecast is expected to rise by 15%

for the 10-year period: 132 GW this LTRA up from over 80 GW in the 2023 LTRA.

•  The aggregated assessment area winter peak demand forecast is expected to rise over almost
18% for the 10-year period: 149 GW this LTRA up from almost 92 GW in the 2023 LTRA.

Transmission Trends
For the first time in recent years, transmission projections reported for the LTRA reflect a significant
increase in transmission development. This year’s cumulative level of 28,275 miles of transmission
(>100 kV) in various stages of development for the next 10 years is substantially higher than the 2023
LTRA 10-year projections (18,675 miles) and is above the average of the past five years of NERC’s LTRA
reporting on average (18,900 miles of transmission planning projects in each 10-year period published
in the last five LTRAs). Transmission in construction has yet to increase substantially; rather, the large
increase in transmission projects is seen in planning stages of development.

New  transmission  projects  are  being  driven  to  support  new  generation  and  enhance  reliability.
Transmission development continues to be affected by siting and permitting challenges. Of the 1,160
projects that are under construction or in planning for the next 10 years, 68 projects totaling 1,230
miles of new transmission are delayed by siting and permitting issues, according to data collected for
the  LTRA.  Questions  of  cost  allocation  and  recovery  can  also  challenge  transmission  development
when  the  benefits  apply  to  more  than  one  area,  as  often  occurs  with  projects  that  enhance
interregional transfer capability.

In  NERC’s  separate  Interregional  Transfer  Capability  Study  (ITCS),  which  was  performed  to  meet
requirements contained in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, NERC found that an additional 35 GW
of  transfer  capability  across  the  United  States  would  strengthen  energy  adequacy  under  extreme
conditions. Increasing transfer capability between neighboring transmission systems has the potential
to  alleviate  energy  shortfalls  in  some  areas  identified  in  this  LTRA’s  Capacity  and  Energy  Risk
Assessment.  Conversely,  when  resource  plans  are  developed  that  address  these  same  energy
shortfalls, such as through resource additions, demand-side management initiatives, or changes to
generator retirement plans, the need for increased transfer capability will also change. Planners have
options for reducing energy adequacy risks from extreme weather. Selecting the best course of action
will depend on weighing these options against various engineering, economic, policy, reliability, and
resilience objectives.

Executive Summary

Recommendations
To  address  the  energy  and  capacity  risks  identified  in  this  LTRA,  NERC  recommends  the  following
priority actions:

1.

Integrated Resource Planners, market operators, and regulators: Carefully manage generator
deactivations.  Independent  System  Operator/Regional  Transmission  Organizations  (ISO/RTOs)
should evaluate mechanisms and process enhancements for obtaining information on expected
generator  retirements  that  would  support  early  identification  of  reliability  risks.  State  and
provincial  regulators  and  ISO/RTOs  need  to  have  mechanisms  they  can  employ  to  extend  the
service  of  generators  seeking  to  retire  when  they  are  needed  for  reliability,  including  the
management of energy shortfall risks. Regulatory and policy-setting organizations must use their
full suite of tools to manage the pace of retirements and ensure that replacement infrastructure
can be developed and placed in service.

2.  NERC  and  Regional  Entities:  Improve  the  LTRA  by  incorporating  new  analysis  and  criteria  to
inform stakeholders of future reliability risks. NERC increased the frequency of the ProbA from
biennial to annual and included unserved energy and load-loss metrics as the basis for risk analysis
in  this  year’s  LTRA.  To  be  more  effective  in  using  energy  criteria  and  outputs  of  probabilistic
analysis, NERC must specify consistent methods and assumptions for assessment areas to follow
in  preparing  the annual ProbA. NERC and the  Regional  Entities,  in  consultation with the RSTC,
should also continue to enhance NERC’s LTRA to assess ERSs in the future system and the potential
impact of new and evolving electricity market practices, regulations, or legislation on resource
adequacy.  Finally,  NERC  should  work  with  the  Regional  Entities  to  perform  wide-area  energy
analysis with modeled  interregional  transfer capability.  Wide-area energy analysis will support
the evaluation of extreme weather and regional fuel supply issues on an interconnection level.

3.  Regulators and Policymakers: Streamline siting and permitting processes to remove barriers to
resource  and  transmission  development.  As  ISO/RTOs  continue  looking  for  opportunities  to
speed transmission planning processes, delays from siting and permitting activities will need to
be reduced. These are the most common causes for delayed transmission projects. Support from
regulators and policymakers at the federal, state, and provincial levels is urgently needed.

4.  Regulators, electric industry, and gas industry member organizations: Implement a framework
for  addressing  the  operating  and  planning  needs  of  the  interconnected  natural  gas-electric
energy system. Various initiatives were launched in the past year to address the reliability needs
that  arise  from  the  complexity  of  interconnecting  natural  gas  and  electric  infrastructure.
Voluntary actions taken by the natural gas industry in response to the North American Energy

Standards Board (NAESB) Forum report are a positive step toward improving winter readiness.
The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) launched its Gas-Electric
Alignment  for  Reliability  (GEAR)  task  force  this  year  and  recently  created  the  Natural  Gas
Readiness  Forum.  For  its  part,  NERC  continues  to  collaborate  extensively  with  industry  and
policymakers.  NERC  has  enhanced  its  Reliability  Standards  requiring  generators  to  prepare  for
winter  extremes,
implement  training,  and  establish  communication  protocols  between
generators and grid operators. Current standards projects encompass extreme weather planning
and  energy  assurance  requirements.  NERC  will  continue  to  provide  full  support  to  initiatives
aimed  at  achieving  a  reliable  interconnected  energy  system  and  urges  regulators  and
policymakers to support needed avenues of coordination between the two sectors.

5.  Regional  transmission  organizations,  independent  system  operators,  and  FERC:  Continue  to
ensure  essential  reliability  services  are  maintained.  The  changing  composition  of  the  North
American  resource  mix  calls  for  more  robust  planning  approaches  to  ensure  adequate  ERSs.7
Retiring conventional generation is being replaced with large amounts of wind and solar; planning
considerations  must  adapt  with  more  attention  to  ERSs.  As  replacement  resources  are
interconnected,  these  new  resources  should  be  capable  of  supporting  voltage,  frequency,
ramping, and dispatchability. Many technologies can contribute to ERSs, including variable energy
resources;  however,  policies  and  market  mechanisms  need  to  reflect  these  requirements  to
ensure  these  services  are  provided  and  maintained.  Regional  transmission  organizations,
independent system operators, and FERC have taken steps in this direction, and these positive
steps must continue.

In addition to these priorities, NERC recommends continued progress in areas identified previously in
NERC’s LTRA and other assessment reports. All recommendations are listed in the Recommendations
and ERO Actions Summary section.

Capacity and Energy Assessment
The  resource  mix  transformation  is  making  traditional  capacity-based  adequacy  criteria  obsolete.
Resource Planners and state and provincial policymakers use resource adequacy criteria to ensure
sufficient  resources  are  available  to  meet  demand.  In  their  application,  current  capacity-based
adequacy criteria were not designed to differentiate between the scenarios, size, frequency, duration,
and  timing  of  energy  shortfalls.  This  has  become  increasingly  important  as  the  resource
transformation  evolves  from  capacity-based  resources  with  assured  and  stored  energy  supplies  to
energy-constrained  resources  that  are  increasingly  impacted  by  weather  and  environmental
conditions.  Therefore,  supplemental  criteria  must  be  adapted  to  properly  assess  system  adequacy
and help determine appropriate solutions. This year’s LTRA includes probabilistic indices to measure
these  additional  dimensions  of  risk  and  provide  a  more  robust  approach  to  understanding  risk  of
inadequacy in future plans.

Assessment Approach
NERC is using two approaches in this LTRA to assess future resource capacity and energy risk; both
are forward-looking snapshots of resource adequacy that are tied to industry forecasts of electricity
supplies, demand, and transmission development:

•  Assessing  load-loss  metrics  determined  from  probability-based  simulation  of  projected
demand and resource availability over all hours. This approach identifies high-risk periods and
potential energy constraints resulting in load-loss events. The 2024 ProbA is performed for
each assessment area and examines the system as planned for the years 2026 and 2028. Loss-
of-load hours (LOLH) and  expected unserved energy (EUE) from  NERC’s ProbA are used to
identify risk levels.

•  Comparing the margin between projected resources and peak net demand, or reserve margin,
to a reserve margin target (known as RML) that represents the accepted level of risk based on
a probability-based loss-of-load analysis.

See  the  Demand  Assumptions  and  Resource  Categories  for  further  details  on  these  approaches.
Assessment area dashboards (see Regional Assessments Dashboards) provide resource capacity and
energy risk assessment results for all areas.

Risk Categories
An assessment area is high risk when established resource adequacy targets or requirements are not
met  during  this  assessment  period.  Regulatory  authorities  or  market  operators  establish  resource
adequacy targets. Most targets in North America are currently based on a 1-day/event load loss in a
10-year planning requirement. See the Summary of Planning Reserve Margins and Reference Margin
Levels by Assessment Area. Recently, regulators and policymakers in many states and market areas
have begun considering or developing resource adequacy targets based on additional criteria that can
better address energy risks and extreme weather-related supply disruption.8 High-risk areas are likely
to experience a shortfall in electricity supplies at the peak of an average summer or winter season.
Unusual heat waves or deep-freeze events pose an even greater threat to reliability.

For the 2024 LTRA, assessment areas are classified as high risk based on an evaluation of the following
criteria for each of the first five years of the LTRA period (i.e., 2025–2029):

•  Annual LOLH exceeds 2.4 hours/year for one or more years in the ProbA.

•  Annual normalized EUE exceeds 0.002% (20 ppm) for one or more years in the ProbA.

•  Resource adequacy target(s) established by regulatory authority or market operator are not

met.

An assessment area is considered an elevated risk when it meets the
requirement,  but
established
probabilistic or deterministic analysis of conditions that are plausible
but  more  extreme  than  normal  seasonal  peaks  are  likely  to  cause
shortfall  in  area  reserves.  More  extreme  conditions  can  include
temperatures  that  result  in  above-normal  demand  levels,  low
resource output or availability, and/or disruption of normal electricity
transfers. In  the analysis, elevated risk may  be found by modeling above-normal demand  and low
resource  availability.  The  risk  can  also  be  identified  by  examining  output  data  from  probabilistic
analysis tools to determine the underlying conditions for load-loss events. Simply put, elevated-risk
areas meet resource adequacy requirements but may face challenges meeting load under extreme
conditions. For the 2024 LTRA, assessment areas are classified as elevated risk based on an evaluation
of the following criteria for each of the first five years of the LTRA period (i.e., 2025–2029):

analysis.

Capacity and Energy Assessment

•  Resource adequacy target(s) established by regulatory authority or market operator are met,
but plausible scenarios of above-normal demand and/or low-resource conditions associated
with a once-per-decade event indicate risk of load loss.

NERC assesses areas as normal risk when resource adequacy criteria
are  met  and  there  is  a  low  likelihood  of  electricity  supply  shortfall
even  when  demand  is  above  forecasts  or  resource  performance  is
abnormally  low  (e.g.,  above-normal  forced  outages  or  low  VER
performance).  Although  areas  categorized  as  normal  risk  are
expected  to  have  sufficient  resources  for  plausible  extreme9
conditions, they are not immune to the effects of high-impact, low-
frequency  weather  events  that  affect  demand  and  generation  simultaneously.  For  the  2024  LTRA,
assessment areas are classified as normal risk based on an evaluation of the following criteria for each
of the first five years of the LTRA period (i.e., 2025–2029):

•  Annual LOLH is below 0.1 hours/year.

•  Annual normalized EUE is negligible or zero.

•  Resource adequacy target(s) established by regulatory authority or market operator are met
and  reserves  are  expected  to  be  available  in  plausible  scenarios  of  above  normal  demand
and/or low resource conditions associated with a once-per-decade event indicate risk of load
loss.

Application of the Risk Criteria: NERC uses industry-provided demand and resource information
and the results from probabilistic assessments performed by NERC Regional Entities, ISO/RTOs, and
regulated utilities to determine risk of energy and capacity shortfalls. The methods, assumptions,
and  approaches  used  by  entities  to  perform  probabilistic  assessments  affect  the  results  and
outputs. In this year’s LTRA, NERC incorporated new probabilistic assessment criteria (LOLH and
EUE) from the NERC-National Academy of Engineering Workshop Report Evolving Planning Criteria
for a Sustainable Power Grid alongside established reserve margin criteria. In instances where an
assessment area’s probabilistic assessment results and reserve margins give mixed indications as
to  the  risk  category,  adherence  to  resource  adequacy  targets  (e.g.,  required  RML  and  load-loss
criteria) established by regulatory jurisdictions took precedence. Any other apparent contradictions

Elevated-Risk Area Details
The below areas are projected to meet resource adequacy criteria and have energy and capacity for
normal forecasted conditions but are at risk of supply shortfall in extreme conditions. Areas are listed
in order of appearance in the Regional Assessments Dashboards section.

MISO
MISO has experienced slower resource additions due to market pressures and constraints faced by
projects  with  signed  interconnection  agreements.  MISO  has  highlighted  uncertainties  with  a  large
number  of  new  resources  that  have  signed  interconnection  agreements  (Tier  1  additions)  and  are
expected to come on-line in the next several years.10 Resource adequacy risks could grow over time
absent the new capacity reflected in the Tier 1 additions and the deferral of announced retirements
(see Risk from Additional Generator Retirements).

PRMs in MISO with resource additions are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. MISO reports 56 GW of
nameplate  generating  capacity,  predominantly  solar  and  batteries,  with  signed  generation
interconnection agreements (qualifying as Tier 1 and reflected in the ARM in Figure 3 and Figure 4) as
of  July  2024  that  can  help  meet  resource  adequacy  needs  if  connection  is  completed.  If  resource
additions remain at or near historically average levels (approximately 2.3 GW/year average over the
last 3 years), PRMs in MISO will fall below the RML reserve margin requirements much faster. Summer
PRMs with average resource additions are shown in Figure 3 as Reserve Margin-Avg Addition.

9 Plausible extreme conditions considered by NERC in this assessment are similar to those experienced during Winter Storm Elliott, Winter Storm Uri, and the 2020 Western Wide Area Heat Dome.

Figure 3: MISO Planning Reserve Margin–Summer

Capacity and Energy Assessment

To  establish  the  RMLs  that  define  the  minimum  reserve  margins  for  resource  adequacy,  MISO
performs  its  annual  probabilistic  Loss-of-Load  Expectation  (LOLE)  Study  per  MISO  tariff.  The  study
produces seasonal RMLs for the upcoming planning year that are used in MISO’s planning resource
auction. These RMLs are calculated such that they define the minimum PRM that will meet an LOLE
of 1 day in 10 years. See the MISO assessment area pages.

MISO is an elevated risk in the 2024 LTRA because probabilistic assessments indicate above-normal
generator  outages  during  extreme  weather  can  result  in  unserved  energy  or  load  loss.  With
uncertainty around new resource additions and existing generator retirements, MISO is also at risk of
falling below RMLs within the next five years.

MRO-Manitoba Hydro
The electricity demand forecast in the province of Manitoba has increased since the 2023 LTRA, driven
by  expected  economic  activity  and  adoption  of  electric  vehicles.  Resource  projections  have  not
changed significantly.

As in prior probabilistic assessments, Manitoba Hydro’s 2024 ProbA indicates that there is some risk
of load loss and unserved energy associated with very low hydro conditions (see Table 2). Electricity
demand peaks in winter, making this the higher-risk season. However, electricity supplies could fall
short  during  either  peak  summer  or  winter  conditions  should  an  extreme  and  prolonged  drought
affect hydro production.

MRO-SaskPower
Resource projections for Saskatchewan over the 10-year period have increased since the 2023 LTRA,
rising to just over 1 GW and include two new 377 MW gas-fired generation facilities, expansion of
existing  gas-fired  generation  facilities,  and  new  geothermal  resources.  The  peak  demand  forecast
growth rate (1.35% annually) has changed little since the 2023 LTRA.

The ProbA for SaskPower indicates there is some risk of load loss and unserved energy that diminishes
with  the  new  resource  additions  that  are  planned  for  2027  (Table  3).  Saskatchewan  is  a  winter-
peaking system; however, the unserved energy risks are more closely associated with the planned
outages of large generators that typically occur in the fall and spring shoulder periods. The months of
September and October are the highest risk periods because of the potential for high temperatures
to unexpectedly extend beyond summer and into the maintenance period.

MRO-SPP
New resource capacity in the interconnection queue—primarily solar, battery, and wind—is currently
projected to keep up with rising peak demand forecasts. DR programs are also increasing over the
next  10  years.  Resource  adequacy  issues  can  arise,  however,  if  generators  retire  earlier  than
anticipated or new resource additions connect more slowly. Currently, there are over 8 GW of coal
and gas-fired generators that have indicated that they may retire within the next 10 years, making the
resource  outlook  unclear.  SPP’s  summer  reserve  margins,  based  on  installed  generator  capacity,
remain above RMLs through 2029 (see Figure 5).

Figure 5: MRO-SPP Five-Year Planning Reserve Margin–Summer

All-hours  probabilistic  analysis  performed  by  SPP  shows  that  resource  adequacy  challenges  are
shifting from summer (when area demand is at its highest) to winter months (when the new resource
mix is less capable of performing reliably). Annual results of the ProbA are in Table 4 below. SPP’s
2023 loss-of-load expectation (LOLE) study results indicate that a separate RML and seasonal resource
capacity  contributions  are  needed  for  the  summer  and  winter  seasons  to  effectively  provide  for
resource adequacy.

NPCC-New England
New England is forecasting unprecedented demand growth driven by electrification of heating and
transportation.  Wind,  solar,  and  batteries  make  up  the  projected  resource  additions,  along  with
growth in distributed energy resources. Since the 2023 LTRA, the peak demand forecast is relatively
unchanged.  New  England  has  among  the  strongest  winter  demand  forecast  growth  rates  of  any
assessment  area,  rising  over  7  GW  in  the  10-year  period,  or  35%  from  its  current  peak  demand
forecast.

The  2024  ProbA  for  NPCC-New  England  reveals  increasing  risk  of  load  loss  and  unserved  energy
compared to the 2022 ProbA (see Table 5). Higher-demand forecast and replacement of dispatchable
resources  with  more  VERs  contribute  to  this  trend.  In  the  ProbA  modeling,  supply  shortfall  risk  is
limited  to  the  summer  months  and  is  associated  with  periods  of  above-normal  demand  and  low
resource output (e.g., low wind, solar, or high thermal outages).

While NPCC’s ProbA results indicate that the risk of unserved energy in New England is concentrated
in summer months, a persistent concern is whether there will be sufficient fuel available to satisfy
electrical energy and operating reserve demands during an extended cold spell or a series  of cold
spells given the existing resource mix and regional fuel delivery infrastructure. Potential natural gas
transportation constraints can affect supply to generators during extreme cold temperatures, when
natural gas demand for space heating is also peaking. Most natural-gas-fired generators in the area
do not have firm natural gas transportation service and can be subject to supply curtailment during
peak conditions. Many natural-gas-fired generators in New England can also operate with stored oil,
providing for assured electricity supply in extreme winter conditions while oil stores are procured and
maintained. Scenarios of extended and extreme cold weather that affect the availability of natural gas
and oil replenishments present a reliability risk but were not within the scope of the 2024 ProbA.

NPCC-Ontario
Near- and long-term resource adequacy challenges continue in the NPCC-Ontario assessment area as
the  Independent  Electricity  System  Operator  (IESO)  manages  lengthy  refurbishment  outages  at
nuclear  generators  and  demand  growth  driven  by  agriculture  and  electrification.  The  beginning  of
projected shortfalls occurs in 2027 when some contracts for firm capacity are set to expire (see Figure
6). However, a number of resources with expiring contracts between 2026 and 2029 are anticipated
to be re-committed for five-year terms through the IESO’s second medium-term procurement, which
is underway. As such, Ontario’s Anticipated Reserve Margins (ARM) and Prospective Reserve Margins
shown  in  Figure  6  (which  do  not  include  this  set  of  expiring  resources)  are  conservative.
Recommitment of these resources is expected to raise margins above the reference level in 2029 and
help maintain reliability through the end of the decade. In May 2024, the IESO finalized long-term
commitments  for  new-build  battery  storage  facilities  (1,784  MW)  and  new-build  natural  gas  and
biogas facilities (411 MW). Early operation incentives anticipated to bring a portion of these resources
online  as  early  as  2027  could  help  alleviate  the  reserve  margin  gap.  The  IESO  also  launched
procurements  for  new  capacity  and  energy-producing  resources  to  be  online  as  early  as  2029.  In
addition, the IESO finalized an agreement with Hydro-Québec for capacity sharing in November 2024,
providing 600 MW of firm imports to Ontario starting in Summer 2025 through Summer 2031. This
capacity is also expected to help alleviate shortfalls indicated in 2027.

The  probabilistic  assessment  for  Ontario  performed  by  NPCC  provides  further  insights  into  the
potential for load loss and unserved energy. There is negligible risk of unserved energy and load loss
in 2026 and earlier years; however, a small risk of load loss (< 0.01 hours) emerges after 2026 (Table
6). The 2024 ProbA study included only years 2026 and 2028, both of which have projected capacity
surpluses  above  RMLs  (see  Figure  6).  If  2027  and  2029  had  been  included  in  the  ProbA,  it  can  be
expected that there would have been higher amounts of LOLH and unserved energy. ProbA results
are also helped by the inclusion of electricity transfers from neighboring areas and modeling for some
operating procedures used to manage supply shortfalls.

PJM
PJM’s  projections  for  generator  additions  in  2025  and  2026  are  scaled  back  dramatically  from  the
2023 LTRA while demand forecasts continue to rise. As a result, ARMs for future years have fallen by
as  much  as  nine  percentage  points  from  last  year.  The  trends  in  demand  growth  and  resource
additions create resource adequacy and system planning challenges for PJM as it carefully manages
generator deactivation requests from the aging fossil and nuclear fleet.

PJM’s ProbA results provide indication of the increasing resource adequacy risk to the system (see
Table  7).  EUE  and  LOLH  are  found  in  both  ProbA  assessment  years  (2026  and  2028)  with  risk
concentrated in the winter months (especially January). The risk occurs on days where temperatures
are  very  low  across  the  entire  PJM  area,  which  results  in  high  loads.  While  normal  resource
performance can meet these demand forecasts, resource performance from thermal resources on
very cold days has historically been below normal due to freezing and fuel supply issues. Furthermore,
solar resources are not likely to contribute during some of the coldest hours, resulting in very low
total electricity supply and thus projections of load loss. ProbA analysis shows some summer load-loss
and unserved energy risk but at much lower levels. Summer shortfall events are most likely to occur
during wide-area heat events that coincide with low wind and low solar output, or very high outage
and derates in the thermal generation.

SERC-East
The addition of solar resources is helping to raise summer on-peak reserve margins in the assessment
area, despite rising demand forecasts and additional coal-fired generator retirements. Since the 2023
LTRA, solar PV resources have grown from 1.5 GW to an expected 4.7 GW by the end of 2024. An
additional 2 GW of solar PV resources are in the process of connecting. The summer peak demand
forecast has also risen since the 2023 LTRA, increasing by 2.8 GW (6.3%) over last year’s projection.
The area reserve margins have increased in the near term as a result of the solar resource additions
then drop off after 2028 due to higher demand forecasts and planned generator retirements.

Despite  these  resource  additions  and  higher  summer  reserve  margins,  the  2024  ProbA  reveals
growing resource adequacy risk in SERC-East (see Table 8). Measures of unserved energy and load-
loss have increased since the 2022 ProbA as demand has risen and the resource mix has changed.
SERC-East has changed from a summer-peaking area to one with peak electricity demand occurring in
both the summer and winter seasons. This  change  is the result  of added solar PV  generation  that
shaves off summer peak demand and trends toward electrification in heating that drives up winter
peak  demand.  The  ProbA  shows  that  the  risk  of  unserved  energy  and  load  loss  is  concentrated  in
winter  (January–February)  months  when  wide-area  extreme  cold  weather  can  affect  electricity
demand, generator performance, generator fuel supplies, and the availability of electricity imports.
Based on current forecasts, resource adequacy risk will increase in SERC-East after 2028 due to the
planned retirement of over 1,800 MW in coal-fired generation and continued load growth.

Texas RE-ERCOT
ERCOT is forecasting explosive demand growth, driven by data center projects, Bitcoin operations,
development in oil- and natural-gas-producing areas, and industrial facilities. Over 20 GW of newly
contracted large loads, in addition to other organic load growth, is projected to be added to ERCOT
by 2028. Substantial amounts of solar PV and battery resources are being added to help meet rising
demand, but there are significant reliability challenges to address during this period of rapid growth.
Resource adequacy risks are mounting as fewer dispatchable resources comprise the resource mix.
One  of  the  strategies  to  address  this  risk  is  state  implementation  of  a  dispatchable  resource
generation loan program called the Texas Energy Fund. Furthermore, the forecasted growth in loads
and resources poses significant challenges for transmission system planners.

Load growth and the characteristics of the resource mix are contributing to higher levels of unserved
energy and load loss in probabilistic analysis (see Table 9). In the 2024 ProbA, EUE for the analyzed
2026 ERCOT system has risen to 19 ppm (0.0019 %) of the total annual supplied energy compared to
the same analysis in the 2022 ProbA. The 2024 ProbA shows an improving trend in the analyzed 2028
ERCOT system, enabled by additional generation capacity from ERCOT scenarios developed to support
rapid growth in large loads.11

A deeper analysis of the probabilistic assessment results reveals the unique characteristics of winter
and summer risk. While peak winter loads can persist for 48 hours or longer, peak summer periods
generally only last for a few hours. This is manifested in the duration and depth of the winter firm
load-shed  events  that  appear  in  the  ProbA  and  has  significant  implications  for  the  reliability
contribution  of  energy-limited  and  non-dispatchable  resources.  The  most  extreme  winter  event
modeled for 2026 was 16 hours in duration and up to 29 GW in load loss. In contrast, most summer
unserved energy events were 1–2 hours in duration.

A key conclusion from the Texas RE-ERCOT 2024 ProbA is that matching the area’s demand growth
with a resource mix that is more variable and less fully dispatchable is increasing the risk of supply
shortfalls  that  can  result  in  load  loss  and  unserved  energy.  When  the  seasonal  characteristics  of
demand and resources are considered, Resource Planners can appropriately focus efforts to reduce
the risk of potentially severe, long-duration winter shortfall events. The Public Utility Commission of
Texas established a Reliability Standard and accompanying reliability assessment process in August
2024. The reliability standard is based on multiple probabilistic reliability measures that capture the
different  dimensions  of  loss-of-load  events:  average  event  frequency  (LOLE),  maximum  event
duration, and maximum event magnitude.

WECC-CA/MX
Resource  additions  continue  to  improve  the  overall  resource  adequacy  outlook  for  the  WECC
California-Mexico assessment area. Since the 2022 ProbA, the planned extension of the Diablo Canyon
nuclear plant (2.2 GW) and resource additions (over 5 GW nameplate in batteries, 3.3 GW nameplate
in  solar  PV,  and  0.2  GW  in  natural-gas-fired  and  geothermal  generation)  have  alleviated  supply
shortfalls that were driving unserved energy and load-loss metrics in year 2026, as shown in the results
of the 2024 ProbA performed by WECC (see Table 10).

Demand  growth  and  planned  generator  retirements  cause  energy  adequacy  risks  to  re-emerge  in
future  years.  With  a  resource  portfolio  that  includes  a  substantial  amount  of  solar  PV,  the  risk  of
supply shortfall is associated with summer evening periods when demand is high and solar output is
diminished. WECC’s analysis for the 2024 ProbA found only a small occurrence (<1 hour) of resources
falling below margin levels for reliability in the 2028 study year. WECC further observed that load-loss
and  unserved  energy  risk  was  localized  in  the  Mexico  portion  of  the  assessment  area,  reflecting
localized resource and transmission system constraints.

11 Due to the inclusion of an additional 20 GW of large loads based on newly signed interconnection agreements, study-year 2028 included additional generation capacity from the “High Large Load Adoption” scenario of the ERCOT 2024 Long-Term System
Assessment (LTSA), which included 22 GW of combustions turbines (CT) and 4 GW of combined cycles (CC).

Capacity and Energy Assessment

WECC’s  interconnection-wide  analysis  simulates  the  probabilistic  performance  of  resource  types
using  historic  hourly  output  data  to  identify  future  risk  periods.  Operators  of  systems  with  large
hydroelectric storage facilities make adjustments to generation based on the level of demand and
shape  the  water  use  within  the  day,  week,  month,  or  between  years.  These  actions  help  posture
hydroelectric generation for expected conditions and can reduce energy shortfall risks.

BC’s supply margins relative to demand are lowest during winter peak demand periods. Imports from
neighbors in the U.S. Northwest are common during these periods, and often during the overnight
hours  of  23:00  to  4:00  local.  WECC’s  analysis  shows  the  need  for  imports  growing  year  to  year
throughout  most  of  the  LTRA  forecast  horizon.  A  widespread,  extreme  cold  weather  event  in  the
Northwest that limits transfer capability is thus a risk to BC. Even though WECC-BC is expecting only
moderate demand growth and relatively few retirements, diminished surplus capacity in neighboring
areas is negatively affecting the resource adequacy outlook.

Normal-Risk Area Details
All  other  assessment  areas  (see  Figure  1)  are  assessed  as  normal  risk.  In  these  areas,  resource
adequacy  criteria  are  met,  and  there  is  a  low  likelihood  of  electricity  supply  shortfall  even  when
demand  is  above  forecasts  or  resource  performance  is  abnormally  low  (e.g.,  above-normal  forced
outages or low VER performance).

The  CA/MX  2028  system  analyzed  by  WECC  for  the  2024  ProbA  reflects  the  continued  rapid
transformation  of  the  power  grid.  The  analysis  assumes  forecasted  demand  growth  of  3.5  GW,
substantial resource additions (4.6 GW of solar PV, 7.6 GW in batteries, and 0.8 GW of natural-gas-
fired generation imported from repowered coal units in Utah), and the retirement of over 3 GW of
gas-fired generation. As demand grows and the resource mix becomes increasingly variable, periods
of supply shortfalls can emerge. Battery additions and transfers help make up for energy shortfalls
that can arise during evening solar down ramps.

WECC-BC
BC  has  a  predominantly  hydroelectric  generation  system  with  vast  amounts  of  energy  storage
provided by its reservoirs. Winter peak demand in the province is forecast to grow modestly over the
next 10 years, from 11,966 MW this winter to 12,305 MW at the end of the 10-year period. Since the
2023 LTRA, the winter peak demand compound annual growth rate (CAGR) has fallen from 1.0% to
0.3%. Growth rate and reserve margins are higher. While the overall resource adequacy outlook has
improved, the 2024 ProbA indicates the area continues to be at an elevated risk of supply shortfall
during extreme conditions. Drought and extreme cold temperatures in winter can result in periods of
insufficient operating reserves when neighboring areas are unable to provide excess energy.

Western Interconnection-wide probabilistic analysis performed by WECC for the 2024 ProbA reveals
that risk of reserve shortages emerges after 2026, potentially resulting in unserved energy and load-
loss events during extreme weather. WECC’s analysis identified over five hours in 2028 when high
demand  and  low  supply  from  WECC-BC’s  internal  resources  were  not  able  to  be  remedied  with
imports from neighboring areas experiencing similar conditions (see Table 11). In contrast, 2026 had
no unserved energy or load-loss periods. An examination of hourly results showed that imports from
neighbors were more available in 2026 to cover periods of potential shortfalls in BC Hydro’s internal
resources.

Capacity and Energy Assessment

Resource and Demand Projections
The  Capacity and Energy Assessment section in this LTRA is a forward-looking snapshot of resource
adequacy  that  is  tied  to  industry  forecasts  of  electricity  supplies,  demand,  and  transmission
development. Later sections in this report describe important trends in each of these forecast areas.
The future electricity supply will come from a resource mix that is more variable, weather-dependent,
and  reliant  on  natural  gas  for  fuel,  requiring  broad  coordination  and  careful  attention  to  manage
reliability risks. Future electricity demand is being shaped by many factors that collectively influence
peak demand forecast levels, peak seasons, and hourly profiles. Peak demand and energy forecasts
are projected to continue rising dramatically over the 2024 LTRA assessment period, exceeding their
highest rates in recent years. Ongoing challenges with resource and transmission development and
the continued pace of generator retirements raise concerns that, in the future, the risk assessment
map will expand with more elevated and high-risk areas.

Risk from Additional Generator Retirements
Accelerated retirements of the existing coal, natural gas, and nuclear generators can have a profound
and negative effect on the resource adequacy and reliability of the BPS in the next 10 years. In this
preceding    Capacity  and  Energy  Assessment  NERC  accounted  for  nearly  79  GW  of  fossil-fired  and

nuclear  generator  retirements  that  are  anticipated  through  2034.  Environmental  regulations  and
energy  policies have the  potential to influence  generators to seek deactivation during the 10-year
assessment period.12 An additional 43 GW of fossil-fired generators have announced plans to retire
over the decade but have yet to enter deactivation processing with the planning authorities. These
retirements,  along  with  the  confirmed  retirements,  contribute  to  declining  reserve  margins  in  the
assessment areas over the next 10 years (see Table 12). As a result of demand growth and generator
retirements, ARM is projected to fall below RML in 18 of the 20 assessment areas by 2034. While
forecasts  such  as  this  factor  into  resource  planning  and  market  mechanisms  to  obtain  resources
needed for resource adequacy, it underscores the significant resource growth needed across North
America. The lack of dispatchable resources and diverse generator fuel types in the interconnection
processes makes the future resource mix look alarmingly unreliable. The potential for capacity and
energy shortfalls and a higher-risk resource mix is heightened by economic and policy factors that
place pressure on existing thermal generators.

The yearly projections of future retirements and an assessment area view are provided in the Risk
from Additional Generator Retirements section.

12 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule on May 9, 2024, establishing Greenhouse Gas Standards and Guidelines for Power Plants (the “GHG Rule”). This rule was released concurrently with three other EPA regulations that impact
fossil-fueled power generation: Coal Combustion Residuals, Effluent Limitations Guidelines, and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. Collectively, these four new regulations impose considerable financial and operational challenges on coal-fired generators.

Reducing Resource Capacity and Energy Risk
The risk of electricity supply shortfalls in the assessment period can be lowered through the concerted efforts of resource and system planning stakeholders. The actions taken in electricity markets and regulatory
jurisdictions  with the improving trends noted  previously provide examples of what can work: obtaining additional firm resources to meet resource adequacy targets, delaying  generation retirements when
reliability needs dictate, and using capacity targets and energy risk metrics based on better resource and demand models. Specific and actionable recommendations are contained in the Executive Summary.

13 MISO reserve margins in this table reflect MISO Seasonal Accredited Capacity for summer. Adjustments and derates are applied to account for factors affecting expected resource output, resulting in unforced capacity (UCAP) reserve margins that are lower
compared to installed capacity (ICAP) values. For more information see the MISO assessment area page.

Resource Mix Changes
Capacity Versus Energy: Changes in the Way to Plan for Resource Adequacy
Industry’s  methods  of  planning  for  resource  adequacy  need  to  change.  The  modern  power  system  requires  the  enhancement  of  assumptions  and  supplementation  of  risk  information  for  a  better
characterization of the risk. Historically, the resource adequacy criterion has been based on the LOLE metric, which should be no more than 1 event-day in 10 years when the generating resources are less than
load (commonly known as “1-day-in-10”). This has been a design basis for the U.S. electric grid for at least 70 years (with its first formal mention in a 1951 American Institute of Electrical Engineers paper by C.
W. Watchorn) and has historically served the industry well. Two important related but separate discussion topics include considerations for assumptions in the calculation of LOLE and other metrics and the
establishment of the resource adequacy criteria (i.e., traditionally in terms of LOLE-1-day-in-10). The 1-day-in-10 LOLE criterion is commonly converted into a minimum capacity requirement resulting in a
target or RML. In doing this, planners determine the minimum PRM required to maintain a 1-day-in-10 LOLE level. Historically, systems with an actual PRM above the minimum generally have sufficient
resources and provide adequate energy and ERSs that operators need to reliably operate the BPS. Issues can arise in resource adequacy planning processes when planners solely rely on the RML comparison
as the system transforms from an era of certain to more uncertain fuel sources and load behavior. In recent years, NERC has documented warnings of potential energy shortages in its reliability assessments,
while in many cases the RML comparison indicates no shortfall. Substantial uncertainty has been introduced into planning the system with the addition of energy-constrained resources (variable energy
resources such as wind and solar, and, at times, just-in-time fuels such as natural gas) that are highly dependent on weather and environmental conditions. Uncertainty in energy sufficiency is increasing as the
types of resources change, leaving fewer resources that can be dispatched (dispatchable resources) in response to the variable resource availability and greater exposure to constraints in fuel supplies, reservoir
levels, or battery discharge capabilities. Historical generator reliability assumptions based on the idea of well-maintained, well-invested units with an anticipated long life are no longer adequate. This increases
uncertainty as a greater proportion of fossil-fueled resources continue to be retired, often with little notice to system planners. Nameplate values of variable energy resources are not as meaningful as projected
energy availability, and environmental conditions can adversely impact the simultaneous availability of thousands of megawatts.

Probabilistic analysis enhances deterministic transmission planning from an energy adequacy standpoint given the following factors:

•  Considers likelihood of events: It uses historical data to estimate how often different outages and weather conditions might occur.

•  Provides more information: It calculates the average impact of these events, including how often and how long power outages might last.

•  Helps compare options: It enables the selection of the upgrade(s) that provide the best balance between cost and reliability over time to be chosen.

Resource Mix Changes

Changes in Existing BPS Resource Capacity
Thermal generator retirements and new resource additions continue at a rapid pace. Since the 2023
LTRA,  over  8  GW  of  coal-fired  generation  has  been  retired,  while  substantial  solar  and  battery
resources have connected to the grid (see Table 13). From a strictly on-peak capacity perspective,
there has been little change (8,348 MW is 0.8% of the total BPS summer on-peak resource capacity.)

This year-on-year change in on-peak capacity continues the general trend of declining baseload and
dispatchable generation—which includes coal-fired, natural gas, and nuclear generators—and rising
VERs. Figure 7 shows the trend continuing through 2034, where 20% of the generating capacity will
be provided by VERs. Focusing on the relatively small change in total on-peak capacity since 2023 can
mask risks to reliability that result when important attributes of the retiring generation resources are
not  inherent  in  the  replacement  resource  mix.  Thermal  generation  resources,  such  as  coal-fired
generators, have the capability to be dispatched when needed and provide system inertia, dynamic
reactive  support,  and  frequency  response  for  stable  grid  operation.  Most  types  of  replacement

resources have limited or none of these attributes. Further, retirements in the thermal generator fleet
are making the resource mix less effective in meeting winter energy needs.

Figure 7: North America Total Generation Capacity in 2024 and 2034

Capacity Additions
New generation is added to the BPS through the area interconnection planning processes. Solar PV is
the overwhelmingly predominant generation type being added to the BPS, followed by battery and
natural-gas-fired generators, wind turbines, and hybrid resources. Batteries are now the second most
predominant resource in the North America BPS interconnection queues. A summary of generation
resources in the interconnection planning queues is shown in Figure 8.

Capacity in planning has grown since the 2023 LTRA by over 44 GW (12%). In general, Tier 1 resources
are in the final stages for connection, while Tier 2 resources are further from completion (see text
box).  Some  projects  that  are  in  the  earlier  stages  of  the  interconnection  queue  process  will  be
withdrawn before completion due to supply chain issues, planning and siting challenges, and business
or  economic  factors.  While  interconnection  queues  continue  to  swell,  considerable  uncertainty

Solar PV and wind nameplate capacity, both existing and planned, vary widely by area. Figure 9 and
Figure 10 show current solar PV and wind installed capacities and the capacity in the planning process
through 2034 for assessment areas with significant amounts. In addition, hybrid generation resources,
which combine energy storage with a generating plant (i.e., a wind or solar farm), are connecting to
the grid in parts of North America, and many more projects are in BPS planning processes.

Resource Additions – How Much and When?
The added resource capacity on the BPS over the past year fell short of industry’s projections, raising concerns that demand growth has the potential to outpace supply resources. The figures below compare
the 2023 LTRA projection of this year’s installed capacity against the actual current installed capacity derived from data collected for this LTRA. Natural gas, solar PV, and wind resources were all over-projected
last year. This gives evidence to industry reports of construction delays that prevented the expected interconnection of new resources. To a lesser extent, project withdrawals prior to commercial operation
also contributed to lower-than-expected resource additions. One key exception—battery energy storage systems (BESS)—came in higher than last year’s projections. As baseload and dispatchable generation
continue to retire, delayed addition of new resources presents a challenge to near- and long-term planning.

Comparison of Projected Capacity from the 2023 LTRA to the Actual Capacity in the 2024 LTRA

The sluggish  rate at which new  generation moves through the interconnection queue and  begins service has been a cause for  concern for long-term reliability planning. The Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory published the results of an interconnection queue study in April 2024 assessing that less than one-fifth of generation capacity projects seeking interconnection between 2000 and 2018 actually
came to fruition by the end of 2023.16 Wait times have also been on the rise: According to the same study, the time from initiating a request for interconnection to the start of commercial operations has
increased from less than two years, as was the case from 2000–2007, to more than four years from 2018–2023. The delay in bringing new generation capacity online in assessment areas that are anticipating
steady or accelerated thermal capacity retirements, as well as increased demand, presents a significant reliability risk.

In recognition of the interconnection backlog risk, some regional transmission organizations have taken steps to address the lagging completion rates. MISO has assigned multiplication factors to generator
requests based on the study phase and the likelihood of that resource coming on-line to more accurately gauge the likely incremental capacity in its footprint.17 MISO also continues to advance the Joint
Targeted Interconnection Queue (JTIQ) with SPP to resolve binding constraints that have delayed the interconnection process. PJM analyzed the completion rate of its interconnection queue and reported that
less than 16% of resources submitted into the queue between 1999 and 2023 went into operation. The ISO has also applied a reduction to the nameplate capacity of value of Tier 1 resources to reflect the
historical addition rate of new generation. PJM’s interconnection process subcommittee is working on enhancements for new generation to interconnect as a capacity resource. These measures and others
are examples of the broader effort to streamline generator additions and thus offset retiring capacity.

Offshore  wind  plants  are  increasingly  entering  interconnection  queues,  located  around  the
Northeastern United States. Figure 11 shows the current planned capacity in the planning process
through  2034  by  assessment  area.  Currently,  the  existing  offshore  wind  nameplate  capacities  are
small in comparison: a single 29 MW plant in NPCC-New England and a 12 MW plant in PJM.

Battery Resources
As the BPS increases the share of energy provided by VERs, the ability to provide energy by BESS or
hybrid-solar PV and wind plants is increasingly important. While currently installed capacity totals just
over 17 GW, an additional 306.5 GW of BESS are in planning. Figure 12 shows the nameplate capacity
of BESS resources currently in operation and in planning for connection to the BPS through 2034.

Figure 12: Battery Resource Capacity Existing and Planned through 2034

BESS are improving reliability by helping to offset the variability  and uncertainty of inverter-based
resources  (IBR).  BESS  are,  however,  a  relatively  new  type  of  grid  resource  with  unique  operating
characteristics.  The  joint  NERC-WECC  Staff  Report:  2022  California  Battery  Energy  Storage  System
Disturbances18 highlights an event when a BESS, like some other IBRs, failed to properly ride through
a normal system fault. This indicates that BESS must be included in the currently underway strategies
to address IBR performance issues.

Because the electrical output of variable energy resources (e.g., wind, solar PV) depends on weather
conditions,  on-peak  capacity  contributions  are  less  than  nameplate  capacity.  Table  14  shows  the
nameplate value and the capacity contribution of existing wind, solar PV, hydro, and energy storage
systems resources at the peak demand hour for each assessment area. During risk periods after peak
demand  (e.g.,  U.S.  assessment  areas  in  WECC),  contributions  of  solar  PV  resources  output  is
diminished during evening periods and additional resources are needed.

Resource Mix Changes

Solar PV Distributed Energy Resource Growth
Behind-the-meter (BTM) solar PV generators are solar PV resources  connected on the distribution
system, such as residential rooftop solar systems. The rapid growth of BTM solar PV continues with
cumulative levels expected to reach over 123 GW by the end of this 10-year assessment period (up
from 89 GW reported in the 2023 LTRA, an increase of 38%). There are currently 58.7 GW of installed
BTM solar PV across the North American BPS.

BTM  solar  PV  generators,  like  grid-connected  solar  PV,  are  also  VERs.  In  large  penetrations,  their
predictable change in output from the time of day contributes to steep ramps in demand. As the sun
sets and output diminishes, grid resources must make up for the decrease in solar generation and
increase in demand that was being served. The opposite ramp occurs during morning hours; it may
be less impactful  to reliability but  can be challenging for grid-connected generator scheduling and
dispatch. Figure 13 shows the current and projected BTM solar PV by area through 2034.

Generation Retirements
The  total  capacity  of  traditional  baseload  generation  fuel  types  will  continue  to  decline  as  older
generators  retire.  Generators  become  confirmed  for  retirement  according  to  various  processes  in
place  in  the  Interconnections,  such  as  regional  planning  tariffs  in  the  wholesale  electricity  market
areas or the integrated resource planning process in vertically integrated states. Properly designed
mechanisms can prevent generators from retiring before planners can study and address reliability
issues that could occur.

Currently,  over  79  GW  of  fossil-fired  and  nuclear  generating  capacity  is  being  retired  over  this
assessment period (see Figure 14), a small decrease from the 83 GW in retirements reported in the
2023 LTRA. This capacity includes generators that are confirmed for retirement through retirement
planning processes or that have indicated plans to retire to an ISO/RTO or Planning Coordinator.

Additional fossil-fired generator retirements are expected and would result in further loss of existing

interconnection  planning  process,  and  the  announced  plans  or  timing  may  be  subject  to  change
before  the  retirement  is  confirmed.  Wholesale  electricity  market  areas,  where  merchant  electric
generators  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  generating  fleet,  have  more  uncertainty  around  future
generator retirements, making resource planning and adequacy assessment difficult. Figure 15 shows
the total capacity of reported retirements (i.e., reported to ISO/RTOs and planning entities) as well as
owner-announced, unconfirmed retirements of fossil-fueled and nuclear generators across the BPS
over the next 10 years in each assessment area.19 This total of confirmed and announced-potential
retirements over the next 10 years is over 115 GW (3 GW lower than 10-year projections in the 2023
LTRA).

Figure 15: Projected Capacity Retirements of Nuclear and Fossil Generation
2024–2034

Natural Gas Fuel Reliance Trends
Natural-gas-fired generators are and will remain a critical resource for BPS reliability in many areas
over  the  10-year  assessment  period,  especially  during  winter.  These  generators  provide  many
necessary reliability attributes that are exiting the system as traditional generators retire and inverter-
based  renewable  resources  take  their  place  in  the  resource  mix.  Natural-gas-fired  generators  are
dispatchable and provide the ERSs of inertia, frequency response, and ramping flexibility. In winter,
when peak demand in most areas occurs during early morning hours, natural-gas-fired generation is
at its highest contribution to the resource mix in many areas. Severe winter weather events in 2021
and 2022 provided stark  evidence of the  critical nature of natural gas as a  generator fuel and  the
importance of secure supplies during times of extreme electricity demand.

As  the  generation  resource  mix  evolves  and  becomes  more  weather-dependent,  fuel  assurance
becomes  increasingly  critical  when  conducting  reliability  assessments.  Until  recently,  comparing
seasonally available capacity to a predetermined PRM level has sufficed as a means to assess resource
adequacy.  However,  resource  adequacy  is  now  only  the  first  step  of  a  meaningful  reliability
assessment. Energy adequacy must now be layered on top to assess the risk that available capacity
may be rendered unavailable due to phenomena including low wind or solar output and/or natural
gas supply and transportation issues.

This  year,  the  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA)  projected  that  more  than  40%  of  delivered
natural gas would be consumed by power generators, more than 0.6 Bcf/d higher than was consumed
by power generators in 2023 and 7% higher than what the EIA had projected for 2024 in the fall of
last year. Natural-gas-fired power plants generated 42% of the electrical energy consumed by end-
use electricity customers in 2023 and are on track to maintain that share of generation this year. A
significant percentage of natural-gas-fired power plants rely upon as-available, non-firm gas supply
and  transportation  arrangements.  Non-firm  natural  gas  supply  and  transportation  is  generally
sufficient for electric generators most of the year. However, during extreme cold weather, demand
for natural gas by both generators and natural gas distribution companies (generally firm shippers)
can at the same time dramatically increase. In these instances, generators that lack firm supply and
transport  arrangements  are  at  risk  of  fuel  unavailability,  and  when  winter  weather  impacts  gas
production facilities,  the  resulting imbalance in  pipeline injections and withdrawals can  put at risk
even firm pipeline customers as preparatory linepack is rapidly depleted.

19 Confirmed generator retirements are reported to NERC by each assessment area in this 2024 LTRA development process. NERC obtained data on announced, unconfirmed generator retirements from Energy Ventures Analysis, Inc. and from each assessment
area. Some sources of information on announced generator retirements include EIA 860 data, trade press, and utility integrated resource plans.

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
28

Resource Mix Changes

The  2024  LTRA  projects  that  an  additional  6,500  MW  of  new  natural-gas-fired  generation  will  be
added in North America over the next five years. While some assessment areas project net decreases
in natural-gas-fired capacity, other areas report increases ranging from 3% to over 50%.

In the United States, 8 out of 13 assessment areas are adding capacity to their fleet of natural-gas-
fired power plants over the next 10 years, amounting to over 10 GW of new natural-gas-fired power
capacity. Altogether, those additions translate to an increase in natural gas use for power generation
of  more  than  84  Bcf  (245  MMcf/d).  Whether  this  increase  in  natural  gas  generation  capacity  is
sufficient to meet the increase in net internal demand projected for these same assessment areas
remains  to  be  seen,  but  based  on  the  capacity  additions  alone,  some  areas  are  set  to  see  an
insufficient increase in gas pipeline capacity, as per the EIA’s database of nationwide U.S. gas pipeline
projects. (see Figure 16).

PJM is one such area, projected to see a 3% increase in natural-gas-fired generation capacity (+2,500
MW). Net internal electricity demand in PJM is forecasted to rise by 25 GW over the planning horizon
at the same time that non-variable resources are expected to shrink their share of the capacity mix
from 96% to 88%. To the extent that variable resources are uncertain during times of peak stress on
the grid, there is a risk of gas delivery capacity being insufficient for the amount of natural gas supply
that could be required to meet the demand increase. SPP is another assessment area where natural-
gas-fired power capacity is set to rise, by 5%, or roughly 1,500 MW. In both PJM and SPP, there is a
risk of a shortfall in natural gas pipeline capacity that could facilitate delivery of the additional fuel
that is necessary to meet their capacity expansion plans.

Reliability Implications
The addition of variable resources, primarily wind and solar PV, and the retirement of conventional
generation are fundamentally changing how the BPS is planned and operated. With electricity supplies
coming increasingly from VERs and natural-gas-fired generators, there is a growing risk that supplies
can fall short of demand during some periods. Geographically diverse wind and solar resources and
loads  can  help  reduce  these  risks,  but  they  require  robust  transmission  networks,  comprehensive
energy and transfer capability analysis, and effective operating procedures and market mechanisms.

Maintaining ERSs for Grid Support
For the grid to operate reliably, it needs resources that are not only sufficient for meeting demand
and energy requirements but also capable of controlling voltages, maintaining stable frequency across
the system, and flexibly ramping up or down to dispatch control at all times. Conventional generators,
such as nuclear, coal, and natural gas-fired generators, provide much of the ERSs that support reliable
operation today. New resources on the grid are almost all IBRs, which have different physical and
operating characteristics that affect the level of ERSs that they can provide. Without the spinning mass
or traditional excitation systems providing the voltage control of a hydroelectric or thermal generator,

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
29

Resource Mix Changes

most IBRs have limited capability for maintaining system voltages and stability. Batteries, with their
fast response time, have some ERS capability that wind and solar do not. They are useful in regulating
system frequency and are helping to balance variability from VERs in ERCOT and California where wind
and solar make up a large portion of the resource mix.20 As generators are deactivated and replaced
by new types of resources, ERSs must still be maintained for the grid to operate reliably.

Accelerated generator retirements, especially unanticipated requests for deactivation, can cause ERS-
related  reliability  issues  in  parts  of  the  system  due  to  the  future  loss  of  the  generator’s  reliability
attributes.  This  reduction  in  the  level  of  ERSs  can  result  in  voltage  violations  or  system  instability.
System  planning  and  generator  deactivation  processes  evaluate  these  changes  to  the  system  and
ensure plans proceed only when reliability criteria, including ERS-related considerations, are met. For
example, PJM’s deactivation process identified reliability concerns to the system as a result of the
requested  deactivation  of  the  Brandon  Shores  power  plant  (1,280  MW)  in  2023.  Until  necessary
system upgrades are completed to address identified system voltage and other reliability issues that
would  occur  with  the  deactivation,  PJM  has  requested  that  the  Brandon  Shores  generators  at  the
plant remain in service through the reliability-must-run process.21

To ensure the future system can operate reliably, market operators, system planners, regulators, and
policymakers need to ensure effective mechanisms are in place to provide for the ERS needs of the
future  system.  Long-term  activities  can  provide  incentives  to  generators  with  needed  reliability
attributes.  Effective  backstops  will  also  be  needed  to  prevent  the  loss  of  critical  generators  when
analysis finds deactivation would violate reliability criteria.

Specific and actionable recommendations are contained in the Recommendations and ERO Actions
Summary section of this report.

Demand Trends and Implications
Demand and Energy Projections
Electricity peak demand and energy growth forecasts over the 10-year assessment period continue to
climb higher than at any point in the past two decades. The aggregated assessment area summer peak
demand forecast is expected to rise by over 132 GW, and aggregated winter peak demand forecasts
are increasing by 149 GW. The growth rates of forecasted peak demand (see Figure 17) and energy
(see Figure 18) continue to rise sharply since the 2022 LTRA, reversing an almost two-decade trend of
falling or flat growth rates. See Figure 17 for seasonal peak demand growth over the current and prior
assessment periods and Figure 18 for net energy growth. A map of the primary demand drivers for
the North American BPS is illustrated for each assessment area in Figure 19.

Electrification and Demand Growth
Electrification of household appliances (e.g., heat pumps for household heating) and projections for
electric  vehicle  growth  over  this  assessment  period  are  components  of  the  demand  and  energy
estimates provided by each assessment area. Since the 2023 LTRA, peak season CAGR has risen in all
assessment areas except two: NPCC-Maritimes’ winter CAGR fell from 0.98% to 0.63% and WECC-BC’s
winter CAGR fell from 1.05% to 0.28%. Rising peak demand forecasts are contributing to the lower
reserve margins projected for nearly all assessment areas.

Large Commercial and Industrial Loads
Increasing  amounts  of  large  commercial  and  industrial  loads  are  connecting  rapidly  to  the  BPS.
Emerging large loads, such as data centers (including crypto and AI) and hydrogen fuel plants, present
unique challenges to forecasting and planning for increased demand. Earlier this year, NERC’s RSTC
established a Large Loads Task Force  to better understand the reliability implications of growth in
large loads and develop solutions.

Demand Trends and Implications

Peak Season Transition
Some of the sharpest peak demand forecast increases and growth rates can be seen in winter seasons
as electrification in heating systems and transportation influence forecasts. Dual-peaking or changing
from  summer  to  winter  peaking  is  anticipated  in  several  areas,  including  the  U.S.  Southeast  and
Northeast. Electrification of heating systems and the anticipated growth of electric vehicles (which
are expected to charge overnight and  coincide with  periods of electricity  demand for heating) are
driving  factors.  Such  changes  have  wide-ranging  implications  for  how  the  grid  and  resources  are
planned and operated. For example, resource output and fuel risks are significantly different in winter,
requiring  the  focus  of  resource  adequacy  processes  to  change.  The  following  are  the  areas  that
anticipate  a  change  from  a  summer-peaking  system  to  a  winter-peaking  (or  dual-season  peaking)
system and the approximate year of the transition:

•  NPCC-New England (mid-2030s)

•  NPCC-New York (mid to late-2030s)

•  NPCC-Ontario (2030)

In  the  U.S.  Southeast,  SERC-Central  and  SERC-East  became  dual-peaking  systems  in  recent  years.
SERC-Southeast  recently  began  experiencing  slightly  higher  peak  demand  in  winter  compared  to
summer.

Reliability Implications
Demand  and  energy  growth  projections  in  this  assessment  period  provide  both  challenges  and
opportunities for electric grid reliability. Planning for resource and transmission adequacy requires
accurate long-term forecasting, but future demand and energy use will be influenced by many factors,
including  the  economy,  energy  policies,  technology  development,  weather,  and  consumer
preferences.  Changing  patterns  in  electricity  use,  load  behavior,  and  distributed  energy  resource
performance affect the accuracy of operational load forecasts that are essential to grid operators.
Large  flexible  loads  and  demand-side  management  programs  hold  promise  for  peak  load
management capabilities that can reduce the risk of firm load interruption.

Anticipating large commercial and industrial loads, electrification, electric vehicle adoption, and the
impacts of energy transition programs on future demand and energy needs will require even more
focus for planners and operators. Peak demand forecast changes in the past year had a noticeable
effect  on  resource  adequacy  for  many  areas.  A  confluence  of  factors  (economic,  energy  policies,
technology development, and consumer preferences) has the potential to fuel continued growth.

Capability

development  are  for  tie-lines  and  tie-line  upgrades,  which  support  transfer  capability  between
neighboring  Balancing  Authority  areas.  See  the  transmission  summaries  at  the  end  of  each
assessment  area’s  pages  (in  the  Regional  Assessments  Dashboards)  for  current  transmission
development details.

Transmission Projects
This year’s cumulative level of 28,275  miles of transmission (>100 kV) in construction or stages  of
development for the next 10 years (see Figure 20) is substantially higher than the 2023 LTRA 10-year
projections (18,675 miles) and is above the average of the past five years of NERC’s LTRA reporting on
average (18,900 miles of transmission planning projects in each 10-year period published in the last
five LTRAs). Transmission in construction has yet to increase substantially; rather, the large increase
in transmission projects is seen in planning phases.

Figure 21: Future Transmission Circuit Miles by Primary Driver

Transmission  development  in  some  areas  is  hampered  by  siting  and  permitting  challenges.  Of  the
1,160 projects that are under construction or in planning for the next 10 years, over 110 projects are
currently  delayed  from  their  expected  in-service  dates.  Siting  and  permitting  issues  are  the  most
common  cause  for  delays,  affecting  68  projects  (totaling  1,230  miles  of  new  transmission).  Other
reasons for delays include economic impacts, planning and construction issues, or changing needs.

Figure 20: Future Transmission Circuit Miles >100 kV by Project Status

New transmission projects are being driven to support new generation and enhance reliability. Figure
21  shows  the  percentage  of  future  transmission  circuit  miles  by  primary  driver.  Most  projects
reported  this  year  have  been  initiated  for  the  purpose  of  grid  reliability,  which  generally  includes
transmission projects that are needed to ensure that the BPS operates within established limits and
design  criteria.  Some  substantial  new  projects  to  integrate  renewable  generation  are  also  in
development  or  are  entering  planning  processes.  Nearly  70  of  the  1,160  transmission  projects  in

Transmission Development and Interregional Transfer Capability

Interregional Transfer Capability Study (ITCS)
The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 202322 required NERC to conduct a comprehensive study of existing
and  future  interregional  transfer  capability  between  each  Transmission  Planning  Region23  (TPR)  to
make  recommendations  for  prudent  additions  to  the  amount  of  power  that  can  be  moved  or
transferred between neighboring TPRs and to make recommendations on how to meet and maintain
transfer capability. In addressing this legislation, NERC identified additions to transfer capability that
could support energy adequacy.24 NERC filed the completed study report with FERC on November 19,
2024.25

Transfer Capability is the measure of the ability of the interconnected electric systems to reliably
move or transfer electric power from one area to another area by way of all the transmission lines
(or paths) between those areas under specific system conditions. The units of transfer capability
are in terms of electric power, generally expressed in MW.

To  provide  further  opportunities  for  stakeholder  engagement  and  consultation,  the  project  was
divided into several stages, each with an accompanying report.

•  Overview  of  Study  Need  and  Approach26:  Provided  background  and  context  regarding
transfer capability calculations and the approach for recommending prudent additions, laying
the foundation for the ITCS as a whole and its associated methods. (published in June 2024)

•  Transfer Capability Analysis (Part 1)27: Addressed the first part of the congressional directive,
which mandated a transfer capability analysis between each pair of neighboring TPRs, as well
as the simultaneous import capability of each TPR. (published in August 2024)

•  Prudent Additions Recommendations (Part 2) and Meet/Maintain Recommendations (Part
3):  Contained  an  energy  margin  analysis  and  resulting  recommendations  for  prudent28

during, for example, extreme weather events. It also discussed how to meet and maintain
transfer capability as enhanced by these prudent additions.

•  Canadian Analysis: Due to the interconnected nature of the BPS, NERC will extend the study
beyond  the  congressional  mandate  to  identify  and  make  recommendations  to  transfer
capabilities from the United States to Canada and among Canadian provinces.29

Transfer Capability Analysis (Part 1)
Adequate transfer capability is fundamental to the reliable operation of the BPS. Balancing Authorities
may  rely  on  their  neighbors  to  supply  energy  for  various  purposes,  including  economic  or  policy
reasons. Transfer capability is also essential under stressed operating conditions, allowing Balancing
Authorities to maintain reliability by importing needed energy from their neighbors. As the resource
mix  becomes  increasingly  dependent  on  just-in-time  and  weather-dependent  fuel  and  energy  for
wind and solar, the ability to transfer electrical energy from areas of surplus to areas experiencing
fuel or energy constraints has become essential to maintaining reliable delivery of electricity to end-
use customers.

The ITCS is a congressionally mandated study to
evaluate transfer capability and recommend
additions to strengthen reliability.

A  holistic  view  of  the  interconnected  system  and  a  thorough  understanding  of  its  behavior  are
essential when calculating or increasing transfer capability. When neighboring TPRs transfer energy
over  a  highly  interconnected  system,  the  energy  flows  over  many  different  lines  based  on  the
electrical characteristics, or impedance, of traveling each route, unless there is specific equipment
used  to  control  flows.  As  a  result,  energy  typically  flows  not  only  across  the  tie  lines  that  directly
connect the exporting (source) TPR to the importing (sink) TPR but over many routes, some of which

24 As evidenced during recent operational events including Western Interconnection Heatwave (2020), Winter Storm Uri (2021) and Winter Storm Elliott (2022), more needs to be done to support energy adequacy to be able to continuously meet customer
demand. This is the reliability risk that the ITCS seeks to identify and mitigate through additions to transfer capability.

Transmission Development and Interregional Transfer Capability

Recommendations  for  Prudent  Additions  (Part  2)  and  to  Achieve  Transfer
Capability (Part 3)
Part 2 of the ITCS evaluated the energy adequacy of the BPS should past weather conditions occur
again in 2033. Specifically, the study applied 12 past weather years to the 2033 loads and resource
mix using the current transfer capabilities as calculated in Part 1. The Part 2 study then evaluated the
impact  that  additional  transfer  capability  could  have  in  mitigating  the  identified  resource
deficiencies30 during extreme events, thereby improving energy adequacy. Using a six-step process,
the  ITCS  developed  a  list  of  recommended  additions  to  transfer  capability.  Figure  22  shows  the
existing  and  potential  new  interfaces  where  additional  transfer  capability  is  recommended.  While
there  are  several  factors  that  Transmission  Planners  consider,  including  reliability,  economics,  and
policy objectives, given NERC’s role as the ERO, the ITCS focused solely on reliability, specifically in
terms of energy adequacy, for these recommendations.

may be running through third-party systems. The way electrical energy flows has broad implications
for calculating and using transfer capability in an interconnected system, especially when traveling
over  long  distances.  For  example,  maintaining  and  increasing  transfer  capability  may  be  highly
dependent on the system conditions within the source and sink TPRs as well as surrounding areas.
Likewise,  transfer  capability  does  not  correlate  one-to-one  with  the  rating  of  new  or  upgraded
transmission facilities.

Part 1 Key Findings
• Transfer capability varies seasonally and under different system conditions

that limit transmission loading—it cannot be represented by a single
number.

• Transfer capability varies widely across North America, with total import

capability varying between 1% and 92% of peak load.

• Observed transfer capabilities are generally higher in the West Coast, Great
Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic areas but relatively lower in the Mountain States,
Great Plains, Southeast, and Northeast. There is limited transfer capability
between interconnections

The  transfer  capability  results  in  the  Part  1  report  reflect  the  conditions  studied  and  are  not  an
exhaustive  evaluation  of  the  potential  for  energy  transfers.  This  study  used  a  set  of  cases
representative of stressed system conditions most relevant for the Part 2 analysis. As such, the study
did not attempt to maximize transfer capability values for each interface through optimal generation
re-dispatch, system topology changes, or other operational measures. Consequently, higher transfer
capabilities  may  be  available  under  different  conditions.  Changes  to  future  resource  additions,
resource retirements, load forecast changes, and/or transmission expansion plans have the potential
to significantly alter the study results.

30 For the purposes of this study, “resource deficiency” is used to describe instances where available resources, including energy transfers from neighbors, are insufficient to meet the projected demand plus minimum margin level.

Transmission Development and Interregional Transfer Capability

The  resulting  recommendations  for  prudent  additions  to  transfer  capability  (Part  2  study)  were
published  in  a  report  along  with  recommendations  to  meet  and  maintain  transfer  capability  as
enhanced by the prudent additions (Part 3).31 Planners have multiple options for reducing the energy
adequacy  and  extreme  weather  risks.  In  addition  to  the  transmission  enhancements  that  were  in
scope  for  the  ITCS,  due  consideration  should  also  be  given  to  constructing  local  generation  and
storage, demand-side management approaches, and grid resilience projects. The ITCS recommended
that planners consider all options and balance reliance on external resources vs. internal resources,
noting that there may be better options than an over-reliance on one or the other.

Part 2 Key Findings

•

Import capability required to reliably serve customers during
extreme conditions varied significantly across the country, so a
one-size-fits-all requirement would be inefficient and ineffective.

• Transmission limitations and the potential for energy inadequacy

were identified in all 12 years studied.

• 35 GW of additional transfer capability is recommended across
the United States to improve energy adequacy under extreme
conditions.

•

Some identified transmission needs could be alleviated by
projects already in the planning, permitting, or construction
phases. If completed, these projects could mitigate several risks
highlighted by the ITCS, reinforcing their importance for grid
resilience.

• The ITCS provides foundational insights for further discussion,

and decisions. Transmission upgrades alone will not fully address
all risks, and a broader set of solutions should be considered,
emphasizing the need for local resources, energy efficiency,
demand-side, and storage solutions.

Emerging Issues
While developing this LTRA, NERC and the industry considered trends and developments that have
the potential to impact the future reliability of the BPS over the next 10 years and beyond. Discussed
below are emerging issues and trends not previously covered in this report that have the potential to
impact future long-term projections or resource availability and operations.

Data Centers and Large Industrial Load
Growth  in  large  load  parcels  like  data  centers  and  industrial  facilities  pose  various  challenges  for
system planners and operators, in addition to fueling rapid demand growth discussed elsewhere in
this report. Figure 23 shows one estimate of data center growth in the United States by 2027.32 Other
types of large industrial loads include smelters, manufacturing centers, hydrogen electrolyzers, and
future electrified mass transit or shipping charging stations. Adding large parcels of load on the system
can add new uncertainties to peak and hourly load forecasting. For example, data centers have longer
operating  hours  and  require  more  heating  and  cooling  than  other  commercial  buildings.  In  Texas,
crypto mining facilities have connected in recent years that scale their operations (and thus electricity
demand) depending on electricity prices. The behavior of large data centers during normal grid faults
is also an emerging concern because customer-initiated automatic disconnecting of sizeable load can
cause operating issues. Sudden and unexpected disconnecting load during a grid fault is analogous to
well-known IBR performance issues and poses similar reliability risks. Planners and operators need to
consider the characteristics of these loads as they begin to proliferate and support NERC RSTC’s Large
Loads Task Force to share best practices.

Figure 23: Projected Growth in Data Centers in the United States

Battery Energy Storage Systems
Planners  and  operators  are  focused  on  requirements  to  model,  study,  and  operate  the  BPS  with
increased BESS and hybrid resources. BESS are increasingly being relied upon in areas with substantial
amounts of solar PV resources to reduce ramping requirements on other resources by discharging in
late afternoon as solar PV output rapidly declines. BESS are also often used for ancillary services, such
as frequency response. Accurately accounting for BESS in operating and planning studies is a challenge
because  it  requires  assumptions  and  modeling  capabilities  for  battery  charging  and  discharging
behavior. In real-time operations, system operators often do not have visibility into battery state-of-
charge, a necessary condition for reliably integrating batteries into system operating plans. Without
such information, operators may be surprised should battery resources fail to deliver when needed.
In Texas, where battery resource growth is among the highest in North America, ERCOT uses a battery
storage data collection program to obtain operational information and is pursuing market rules for
state-of-charge  accounting  in  unit  commitment  processes.  System  planners  in  many  areas  will  be
counting  on  new  BESS  facilities  to  manage  variability  and  demand  and  resources.  Obtaining  the
benefits of these resources requires careful integration into operating, planning, and market designs.

Emerging Issues

Electric Vehicles and Electric Load
With increased adoption of electric vehicles (EV), which use batteries to store energy, there is a need
to understand the impact of battery charging on system performance. EV forecasting is important for
resource  adequacy  and  system  planning  to  account  for  changing  load  and  load  patterns.  It  is  also
important  for  system  studies  to  include  EV  modeling  and  parameterization  that  account  for  the
behavior of battery charging systems on system performance. In January 2024, NERC released the EV
Charging Study, noting that the behavior of large amounts of EV chargers in operation can affect the
BPS response to common outages. The RSTC established an EV Task Force to promote collaboration
among the electric power industry and automotive representatives on areas of grid reliability.

Energy Drought
More reliance on wind, solar, and hydro resources in the resource mix has the potential to expose the
electric system to supply shortages under abnormal weather patterns. When two or more resource
types are simultaneously affected by conditions that cause below-normal resource output, operators
can face challenges in meeting demand. Analysis of U.S. historical hourly generator data indicates that
there are regional patterns to energy drought that can be expressed in terms of duration, magnitude,
and seasonality (See Figure 24). There is also a higher likelihood for energy droughts to be more likely
occur during high-load periods than at other times, underscoring the importance in considering such
events in planning for resource and storage needs.33

Regional Assessments Dashboards
The following assessment area dashboards and summaries were developed based on data and narrative information collected by NERC from the six Regional Entities on an assessment area basis. Guidelines and
definitions are in the Demand Assumptions and Resource Categories table. On-Peak Reserve Margin bar charts show the ARM compared to the RML established for the area to meet resource adequacy criteria.
Prospective Reserve Margins can give an indication of additional on-peak capacity but are not used for assessing adequacy. The operational risk analysis shown in the following regional assessments dashboard
pages provides a deterministic scenario for understanding how various factors that affect resources and demand can combine to impact overall resource adequacy. For each assessment area, there is a risk-period
scenario graphic; the left blue column shows anticipated resources (from the Demand and Resource Tables), and the two orange columns at the right show the two demand scenarios of the normal peak net
internal demand (from the Demand and Resource Tables) and the extreme winter peak demand determined by the assessment area. The middle red or green bars show adjustments that are applied cumulatively
to the anticipated resources. Adjustments may include reductions for typical generation outages (maintenance and forced not already accounted for in anticipated resources) and additions that represent the
quantified capacity from operational tools (if any) that are available during scarcity conditions but have not been accounted for in the WRA reserve margins. Resources throughout the scenario are compared
against expected operating reserve requirements that are based on peak load and normal weather. The cumulative effects from extreme events are also factored in through additional resource derates or low-
output scenarios.

Highlights

•  MISO’s capacity resource turnover continues to occur with coal unit contributions being primarily replaced by solar, wind, and battery facilities. Furthermore, generation installation delays result in uncertainty

throughout the assessment timeframe. As a result of these factors, MISO is facing capacity shortfalls in the next five years.

•  MISO’s reduction in capacity resources since the 2023 LTRA has primarily been in the coal fleet with a reduction of 6,200 MW in the first year of the assessment.

•  MISO has continued the seasonal capacity auction construct and has found growing evidence of risk in non-peak (e.g., spring and fall) seasons. Countering the risk during these off-peak seasons requires more
resources to be available, and this can result in less opportunity for generators to pursue their maintenance needs. During peak seasons when high levels of generator availability are expected, short-notice
unplanned outages and higher forced outages could occur as a result of deferred maintenance and challenge reliability.

MISO Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The planning reserves across the MISO footprint in the summer are projected to fall below reserve
margin requirements as new generation coming on-line could be insufficient to make up for generator
retirements and load growth. It is important to note that there is 56 GW of generation with signed
generation interconnection agreements that are yet to come on-line as of July 5, 2024, so there is an
opportunity  to  accelerate  installation  speeds.  However,  if  resource  additions  remain  at  or  near
historically average levels (approximately 2.3 GW/year average over the last 3 years), PRMs in MISO
will  fall  below  the  RML  reserve  margin  requirements  much  faster.  Summer  PRMs  with  average
resource additions are shown in Figure 3 as Reserve Margin-Avg Addition.

Increased  coordination  between  MISO  and  its  members  will  be  critical  to  ensuring  reliability
throughout this resource transition of integrating new intermittent resources and continuing to retire
conventional resources. Resource adequacy is a key function of MISO, and the MISO annual planning
resource auction (PRA) provides a mechanism for capacity sellers to provide resources that meet the
needs of load-serving entities for each of the four seasons in the upcoming year. MISO’s resource
adequacy construct complements the jurisdiction that regulatory authorities have in determining the
necessary level of adequacy.

Note:  Capacity  values  for  existing  resources  in  tables  on  p.  41–42  reported  by  MISO  reflect  the
Seasonal Accredited Capacity (SAC) for Summer. Adjustments and derates are applied to account for
factors affecting expected resource output. The RML in the Demand, Resources, and Reserve Margins
table on p. 41 is the Unforced Capacity (UCAP) RML, consistent with the reported capacity values.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
The introduction of the seasonal PRA and inputs to the process provide more granularity and reliability
planning for non-peak hour times during the year. In addition to that change, MISO conducts seasonal
resource assessments evaluating generation availability, outage rates, and forecasted load variation
across all four seasons. Refer to MISO’s Resource Adequacy page.

Probabilistic Assessments
To establish RMLs that define the minimum reserve margins for resource adequacy, MISO performs
its annual probabilistic Loss-of-Load Expectation (LOLE) Study per MISO tariff. In recent years, MISO
improved its LOLE study modeling by including seasonal outage rates, correlated cold weather
outage adder profiles, a probabilistic distribution of non-firm support, and 30 years of hourly wind
and solar profiles. The LOLE study produces seasonal RMLs for the upcoming planning year that are
used in MISO’s planning resource auction. These RMLs are calculated such that they prescribe the

minimum PRM that will meet an LOLE of 1 day in 10 years.  For more information on the seasonal
LOLE Study, visit:
https://cdn.misoenergy.org/LOLE%20Study%20Report%20PY%202024-2025631112.pdf.

MISO also performed a probabilistic analysis for the 2024 ProbA. Because MISO used the same model
for both the ProbA and the LOLE study, transmission limitations were not included explicitly in the
simulations. It is appropriate for MISO to make this assumption for the LOLE study and for determining
capacity needs in the MISO system because MISO accounts for transmission limitations elsewhere in
the resource adequacy process. However, for an adequacy assessment like the ProbA, the assumption
can  overvalue  resource  performance  by  not  accounting  for  transmission  constraints  on  the
deliverability of energy resources. The resulting 2024 ProbA metrics in the table below can understate
the risk of unserved energy and load loss.

MISO is an elevated risk in the 2024 LTRA because probabilistic assessments indicate above-normal
generator  outages  during  extreme  weather  can  result  in  unserved  energy  or  load  loss.  All-hours
probabilistic studies of the MISO system performed apart from the 2024 ProbA show that shortfall
risks can also occur during spring and fall in months that are not peak demand seasons for MISO. The
2022 NERC ProbA Regional Risk Scenario Sensitivity Case included seasonal forced-outage rates and
correlated cold weather outages instead of annual average outage rates. MISO found that not only
did EUE increase in this sensitivity, but it was also spread throughout the year. Since this study, MISO
implemented enhancements to its LOLE study and PRA to address seasonal resource needs.

Demand
The peak demand forecast has increased from the 2023 LTRA by close to 3 GW (~2.5%), and, while
the load forecasts still vary across year to year, the load at the end of the study horizon is ~5 GW
higher (~4%). Load-serving entities do not include DR resources in the load forecast, and MISO does
not have much insight into the amount of electrification built into the load forecasts. There are other
studies  at  MISO  investigating  electrification  and  transportation  industry  impacts  to  load  forecasts

footprint’s electrification potential. This is documented in the report and has been utilized to update
the MISO Futures Report.

through the queue cycle. MISO continues to pursue queue reform efforts to expedite the process by
ensuring projects being studied are of adequate certainty.

Demand-Side Management
DR programs continue to play a significant role in providing capacity to MISO. DR is steady around 8
GW in the summer and 6.5 GW in the winter and is projected to remain constant during the study
horizon. MISO’s transition to seasonal auctions highlights accreditation of DR and availability during
non-summer seasons.

Distributed Energy Resources
Behind-the-meter generation (BTMG) resources contribute about 4.2 GW of capacity across the study
horizon, of which ~1.2 GW are distributed PV. MISO’s transition to seasonal auctions highlights the
availability of DERs across the four seasons, and MISO is working with stakeholders to derive adequate
methods of aggregating, reporting, and allowing DER participation in MISO markets.

Generation
The departure of MISO’s coal fleet has continued with a reduction in capacity of around 6 GW in the
past year, and a projected reduction of a further 12 GW over the next five years. Solar continues to
rise in capacity contributions with a growth of 1,200 MW since the 2023 LTRA and growth of 3,200
MW in the first year of the study.

There  are  ~56  GW  installed  capacity  (ICAP)  of  generation  (predominantly  solar  and  battery)  with
signed generation interconnection agreements in MISO that are projected to come on-line over the
next few years. There have been some supply chain and tariff issues that have delayed the commercial
operation of these resources.

Due to the large size in the MISO interconnection queue, in the 2022 LTRA (similarly to the OMS-MISO
Survey), prospective generation in the queue gets multiplied by a factor based on the study phase and
likelihood of that resource coming on-line and gets added into the footprint over time. This reduction
is utilized to minimize the impact of prospective generation projects that will not come to fruition

Transmission

(LRTP)  tranche  1  projects  totaling  $10.3  billion  in  investment  for  reliability  and  economic  benefits
estimated at $23–52 billion across the MISO footprint while also facilitating the integration of ~53 GW
of new resources. In MTEP22, $4.3 billion in transmission projects were approved with $550 million
going toward integrating new resources, $550 million going toward baseline reliability projects, and
the age and condition category for the rest. MTEP23 includes a further $9 billion investment into the
MISO footprint to address the local needs of the region. MISO is also pursuing LRTP tranche 2 with an
expected investment of $18-23 billion to implement a 765 kV backbone into the northern portion of
the footprint. These projects are expected to be included as part of MISO’s MTEP24 project portfolio.
In MTEP24, $6.7 billion in transmission projects have been submitted for board approval. MISO is also
pursuing  LRTP  tranche  2.1  with  an  expected  investment  of  $21.8  billion  to  implement  a  765  kV
backbone into the midwestern portion of the footprint. Tranche 2.1 brings reliability and economic
benefits estimated at $51.7–101 billion across the MISO Midwest footprint, facilitating integration of
~115.7 GW of new resources.

Energy Storage
MISO’s energy storage resources are still primarily in the future with only 84 MW of on-line storage.
The MISO interconnection queue does have a significant amount of energy storage upcoming, but
these are primarily Tier 3 resources at present.

Capacity Transfers

MISO  benefits  from  significant  transfer  capacity  with  neighboring  assessment  areas  due  to  the
geographic  location.  MISO  and  SPP  continue  to  finalize  the  Joint  Targeted  Interconnection  Queue
(JTIQ) portfolio to resolve the binding constraints that have traditionally delayed the interconnection
process.  MISO’s  utilization  of  capacity  transfers  is  identified  in  the  LOLE  report  and  memorialized
through the MISO PRA.

Highlights

•  The electricity demand forecast in the province of Manitoba has increased since the 2023 LTRA, driven by expected economic activity and adoption of EVs. Resource projections have not changed significantly.

•  The ARM falls below the RML of 12% beginning in Winter 2029–2030 due to load growth and the reduction of winter import capacity transfers. Manitoba Hydro is performing analysis to inform its integrated

resource plan and support future decisions for resources.

The Monthly EUE and LOLH for 2026 and 2028 show that the highest LOLH and EUE contribution are
from July and November, respectively, for 2026 and 2028.

The two graphs below show the hourly energy availability on the Manitoba Hydro system during the
ProbA’s highest risk days in 2026 and 2028. Surplus energy and shortfall EUE are plotted for the day
when the highest loss of load event happens in the ProbA analysis. The Probability Weighted Average
(PWA) surplus margin is negative, which indicates possible loss of loads for 2026. However, the PWA
surplus energy is higher for 2028 during the day when the highest loss of load event is observed. This
is because the surplus is an average for different water year data and the average surplus may not
represent the event when loss of load occurs.

MRO-Manitoba Hydro Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The winter ARM falls below the Reference Margin Level of 12% in 2029–2030. No resource adequacy
issues  are  anticipated  until  Winter  2029–2030.  A  Tier  1  project  to  replace  eight  older  and  smaller
hydro units is being planned for the Pointe du Bois Generating Station. The Pointe du Bois Renewable
Energy Project (PREP), approximately 50 MW, replaces the original hydro units that were mothballed
or  retired  based  on  economics/end  of  life  after  about  100  years  of  operation.  No  Tier  2  or  Tier  3
resources have been assumed to come into service during the assessment period.

The ARM falls below the Reference Margin Level of 12% beginning in Winter 2029–2030 due to net
load  growth  and  the  reduction  of  winter  import  capacity  transfers.  Manitoba  Hydro’s  Integrated
Resource  Plan  was  published  in  Summer  2023.  Further  analysis  is  underway  and  will  help  inform
Manitoba Hydro’s future resource decisions for resources in the 2029 timeframe.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
Under  normal  water  conditions,  over  95%  of  the  generation  in  Manitoba  Hydro’s  system  is  from
renewable  energy—primarily  hydro  generation  and  wind  generation.  As  the  operator  of  a
predominantly  hydro  system,  Manitoba  Hydro  frequently  performs  an  all-hours  energy  adequacy
analysis of the near-term through seasonal time periods to manage reservoir energy storage and meet
system demand. Additionally, Manitoba Hydro conducts specific analyses to determine short-term
storage  and  minimum  flow  requirements  for  maintaining  Manitoba  and  extra-provincial  resource
adequacy obligations. As there are modest levels of wind and solar on the Manitoba Hydro system,
the resource adequacy risk on the Manitoba Hydro system over the next five years and under normal
water conditions is expected to coincide with peak demand hours.

There  are  a  number  of  influencing  factors  associated  with  Manitoba  Hydro’s  resource  adequacy
performance, such as the water resource conditions, energy and capacity exchanges with neighboring
jurisdictions, forecast load level, uncertainties in load forecast and load variation profiles, demand
responses, wind penetration, and generation fleet availability. Most of Manitoba Hydro’s generating
facilities are use-limited or energy-limited hydro units. The annual energy output of these facilities is
mostly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  the  water  resource.  In  the  2024  ProbA,  Manitoba  Hydro
examines the impact of the most significant factor over the long run—variations in water conditions.

Nonzero LOLH and EUE are observed for both reporting years of 2026 and 2028 and shown in the
table below. The LOLH and EUE indices are higher compared to the 2022 assessment mainly due to
the increase in the forecast peak demand. Water flow conditions of 10th percentile or lower tend to
increase the LOLH and EUE. As a small winter-peaking system on the northern edge of a large summer
peaking system (MISO), there generally is assistance available, particularly in MISO’s off-peak hours,

Hourly PWA Surplus Margin and Shortfall EUE for 2026 Representative Risk Day (Summer)

The  figure  below  shows  the  surplus  margin  and  shortfall  EUE  for  2028  under  extreme  drought
conditions.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  loss-of-load  event  occurs  when  the  surplus  margin  becomes
negative.  This  surplus  energy  shown  in  the  figure  is  the  average  value  for  this  hour  for  the  entire
simulation. It may not represent each individual loss-of-load event during simulation. By plotting the
hourly surplus and unserved energy for the low-water years, it is possible to see what risk periods are
likely to emerge during extreme drought.

Hourly PWA Surplus Margin and Shortfall EUE for 2028 Representative Risk Day (Summer) During
Extreme Drought Condition

The scatter plots of surplus energy vs. month for 2026 and 2028 are shown in the figures below. In
the months of June and August to November, the PWA surplus energy is relatively lower compared to
the other months due to less import from MISO. The PWA surplus energy in July 2026 is high due to
higher  hydro  energy  availability  for  July.  However,  since  PWA  is  the  result  of  averaging,  positive
surplus energy does not mean that there will be no loss-of-load events.

The Curtailable Rate Program provides approximately 160 MW of load reduction through up to 16
load curtailments of 4¼ hours each on five minutes notice. The program is intended for peak load
management. In addition, one product provides 50 MW of contingency reserves, also on five minutes’
notice.

The terms and conditions of the Curtailable Rate Program were updated in August 2023 to require an
annual curtailment test, increase the number of possible curtailments, extend the notice period for
conversion to firm service, and make minor editorial changes.

Distributed Energy Resources
Manitoba is not currently experiencing large additions of wind and solar resources being seen in other
regions; hence, emerging reliability issues arising from such large wind and solar resource additions
are not anticipated in the next five years. Additions of energy storage resources in the next 10 years
are not anticipated at this time. There is a potential for significant solar DER resources in the latter
half of the assessment period, and plans are being developed to study the impacts on the Manitoba
Hydro  system.  The  potential  for  future  solar  DER  may  be  dependent  on  solar  PV  subsidies  and/or
incentives.

Generation
Manitoba  Hydro  is  monitoring  federal  and  provincial  policy/strategies/regulations  related  to
electricity/energy.  The  Canadian  federal  government  is  considering  significant  carbon  emission
regulations. Through Environment and Climate Change Canada, it is taking multiple steps to develop
clean  electricity  regulations  that  aim  for  Canadian  electricity  generation  to  achieve  net-zero
greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  2035  by  requiring  generating  units  to  meet  a  stringent  emissions
intensity  standard  (measured  in  tons  CO2  equivalent  per  GWh)  and  pay  a  price  for  any  remaining
emissions.  The  proposed  regulations  are  still  in  development  and  not  proposed  to  be  fully
implemented  until  2035,  so  it  is  too  early  to  determine  any  potential  impacts.  The  Province  of
Manitoba is developing a provincial energy strategy/policy which may be released in Fall 2024. As
details are not yet available, it is too early to determine any potential impacts.

Energy Storage
Manitoba Hydro currently has no energy storage resources, and none have been committed to over
the next 10-year period.
The hydro generation resources, while not storing electricity directly, do store water in a reservoir for
conversion to electricity and have been in use for over 100 years. For most hours of the year, the only
dispatchable  resources  online  are  hydro  generation  resources  which  therefore  serve  most
operational, reliability, and economic functions.

PWA Surplus Energy Versus Month for 2026

Demand
Manitoba Hydro’s load-growth forecast is up around 3.2% over the assessment period in comparison
with  the  forecast  used  for  the  2023  LTRA.  Factors  considered  in  load-growth  projections  include
economic activity, EV adoption, and demand-side management programs in Manitoba operated by
Efficiency Manitoba. EV adoption in Manitoba is being driven in part by proposed federal regulations
that  are  expected  to  require  that  at  least  20  percent  of  new  vehicles  sold  in  Canada  will  be  zero-
emission by 2026, at least 60 percent by 2030, and 100 percent by 2035.
Manitoba  Hydro  is  anticipating  load  growth  of  1.3%  over  the  last  half  of  the  assessment  period.
Limited  surplus  firm  generation  resources  (resource  adequacy)  have  the  potential  to  slow  the
connection of very large new industrial loads. In order to limit load growth, Manitoba Hydro has been
directed by the Province of Manitoba to suspend processing of cryptocurrency load connections until
2026.

Demand-Side Management
Manitoba  Hydro  currently  does  not  have  any  form  of  directly  controllable  and  dispatchable  DR
programs. Manitoba Hydro does have an indirectly controllable and dispatchable DR program called
the Curtailable Rate Program.

Capacity Transfers
Manitoba Hydro has coordination and tie-line agreements with neighboring assessment areas, such
as MISO, SaskPower, and the IESO. In accordance with these agreements, planning- and operating-
related  issues  are  discussed  and  coordinated  through  respective  committees.  In  addition  to  this
planning and operating committee work, Manitoba Hydro engages with the neighboring utilities of
Minnesota Power, Xcel Energy, Otter Tail Power, Minnkota Power Cooperative, SaskPower, and Hydro
One  regularly  to  share  information,  discuss  issues,  and  coordinate  activities.  Manitoba  Hydro  also
coordinates  planning  studies  (for  example,  transmission  service  request  studies  and  requests  for
generation interconnections) with its neighboring assessment areas. In addition, capacity transfers
are verified from a resource adequacy perspective with adjacent regions/entities. Significant capacity
transfer limitations from MISO into Manitoba may have the potential to cause reliability impacts but
only in extreme conditions occurring simultaneously.

Transmission
Manitoba Hydro has identified aging components of its HVdc system as a potential reliability issue
that is unique to the assessment area. The concern is that the oldest HVdc system components could
be approaching end of life. Studies have been initiated to study/evaluate modernization options and
alternatives. The studies and procurement of replacement equipment could take up to 10 years to
implement based on the current HVdc market capability. There is currently spare capacity on the HVdc
system, and the end-of-life failure of a single pole would not create reliability issues. The further end-
of-life failure of a second pole, while believed to be a very low probability, has the potential to create
reliability concerns under peak winter loads if mitigation measures are not implemented. Mitigation
measures  to  minimize  the  likelihood  of  experiencing  this  quantity  of  long-term  outages  are  being
actively pursued.

MRO-SaskPower
MRO-SaskPower is an assessment area in the Saskatchewan province of Canada. The province has a geographic area of 651,900 square kilometers (251,700 square miles), with a population of
1.2 million and approximately 550,000 customers. Peak demand is experienced in the winter. The Saskatchewan Power Corporation (SaskPower) is the Planning Coordinator and Reliability
Coordinator for  the  province  of  Saskatchewan  and  is  the  principal  supplier  of  electricity  in  the province.  SaskPower  is  a  provincial  Crown Corporation  and,  under provincial  legislation,  is
responsible for the reliability oversight of the Saskatchewan Bulk Electric System (BES) and its interconnections.

MRO-SaskPower Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
Saskatchewan uses a criterion of 15% as the reference reserve margin and has assessed its PRM for
the upcoming 10 years considering the summer and winter peak hour loads, available existing and
anticipated generation resources, firm capacity transfers, and available demand response for each
year.  Saskatchewan’s  ARM  ranges  from  approximately  19%  to  34%  and  does  not  fall  below  the
Reference Margin Level.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
Saskatchewan  performs  energy  assessments  using  probabilistic  methods  to  inform  the  area’s
resource  adequacy  requirements.  Saskatchewan  evaluates  non-peak  hour  risks  and  diminishing
capacity credits associated with higher penetration levels of VERs as part of the long-term planning
process.

Results of the 2024 ProbA are provided in the table below. Based on the deterministic calculations
within  this  assessment,  Saskatchewan’s  ARM  is  27.8%  and  34.0%  for  years  2026  and  2028,
respectively.  Since  the  2022  ProbA,  the  reported  forecast  reserve  margin  for  2026  has  remained
consistent.  The  minor  variation  in  the  reserve  margin  is  due  to  a  slight  change  in  the  schedule  of
generator  outages.  EUE  is  also  comparable  to  the  2022  ProbA,  with  some  variation  attributed  to
updated hydro energy dispatch, which is able to reduce the EUE in the months where it was highest
in the prior ProbA.

Saskatchewan does not anticipate resource adequacy issues during its off-peak hours. Currently, its
resource mix consists of baseload and fast ramping generation resources, with little penetration of
VERs. The main factor contributing to EUE is the amount of planned generator outages. When these
short-term  reliability  issues  are  identified  in  advance,  they  can  be  mitigated  by  rescheduling  the
maintenance. The hourly EUE heat maps in the following figures show that risk of unserved energy is
at its highest in the summer months. Risk can also be found in months before or after summer and be

driven by unseasonable temperatures driving above-normal demand that coincides with generator
maintenance  periods.  Winter  risks  of  shortfall  are  associated  with  extreme  cold  weather  and
unexpected generator outages.

Demand
Saskatchewan experiences its peak-season in the winter. Saskatchewan’s system peak load forecast
is  based  on  econometric  variables,  weather  normalization,  and  individual  level  forecasts  for  large
industrial customers. The average annual summer and winter peak demand growth is expected to be
approximately 1.35% throughout the assessment period.

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment

Demand-Side Management
Saskatchewan’s  EE  and  energy  conservation  programs  include  incentive-based  and  education
programs  focusing  on  installed  measures  and  products  that  provide  verifiable,  measurable,  and
permanent reductions in electrical energy, and demand reductions during peak hours.

Saskatchewan’s DR consists of contracts with industrial customers for interruptible load based under
conditions specified in demand response programs. The first of these programs provides a curtailable
load, currently up to 72 MW, with a 12-minute event response time. Other  programs are in place
providing access to additional curtailable load requiring up to two hours notification time.

Distributed Energy Resources
The  current  BTM  DER  installed  capacity  in  Saskatchewan  is  approximately  50  MW,  which  includes
approximately  48  MW  of  solar  PV  and  the  remaining  approximately  2  MW  of  distributed  wind
projects. An additional 25 MW of DER solar PV are expected to be added in the next five years. BTM
DER  installations  are  incorporated  into  the  load  forecast  models,  which  are  used  in  supply  and
transmission planning study models.

Small  power  producers  contribute  an  additional  5  MW  installed  DER  capacity  (non-BTM)  in
Saskatchewan. There is currently an existing 8 MW and a potential for up to 20 MW of DERs being
added in the next 2 years based on the currently approved Power Generation Partner program. These
projects  are  included  as  generation  additions,  but  currently  their  capacity  is  not  considered  in
reliability planning.

Generation
Saskatchewan is adding approximately 1,064 MW into its resource mix of generation under the Tier
1 category within the next five years. The includes a 200 MW wind generation facility, expansion of
two existing natural gas facilities totaling 90 MW, two new natural gas facilities totaling 754 MW, 15
MW of flare gas generation, and 5 MW of geothermal generation.

Under Tier 2, over 1,717 MW of new generation is projected in the assessment period. This includes
754 MW of natural gas, 600 MW of wind generation, 300 MW of utility-scale solar generation, and 63
MW of co-generation.

Generating resources being planned as Tier 2 and Tier 3 will replace generators planned for retirement
prior to deactivation. Therefore, Saskatchewan is not expecting any long-term reliability impacts due
to generation retirements.

Energy Storage
SaskPower  currently  has  its  first  battery  storage  system,  a  20  MW/20  MWh  unit,  under
commissioning. There are plans to expand this site by an additional 60 MW/60MWh capacity. The
prevalent  use  for  the  planned  energy  storage  is  to  provide  regulating  reserve,  peak  capacity  and
energy reduction, net demand ramping control, reactive power/voltage control, primary frequency
control, and blackstart.

Capacity Transfers
SaskPower has three interfaces with its neighboring areas. The interface with Manitoba is the largest
of the three interfaces and is the only interface with long-term firm contracts. Capacity transfers from
Manitoba  would  be  limited  in  the  event  of  a  prior  outage  of  tie  lines  between  SaskPower  and
Manitoba Hydro, as well  as nearby transmission facilities supporting  the interface.  This  could only
impact  reliability  if  it  is  coincident  with  the  extreme  winter  or  summer  peak  demand  and  a  prior
outage of one or more larger generating units in Saskatchewan. Risk mitigation is in place through
SaskPower’s emergency  operating  procedure  that  will  allow  one  or  more  measures  such  as  short-
term imports from other available interfaces (for example Alberta or SPP), initiating demand response
and short-term load shedding.

Transmission
SaskPower's major transmission projects in the first five years of the assessment period are related to
the interconnection expansion with SPP and the 650 MW of new transmission service. This includes
two new international power lines between Saskatchewan and North Dakota. Within Saskatchewan,
a  total  of  approximately  180  kilometers  of  new  230  kV  lines,  a  new  230  kV  transmission  station,
expansion of several existing transmission stations, and installation of two phase-shifting transformer
interfaces and two static var systems are being added.

The  remaining  other  transmission  projects  (approximately  460  circuit  kilometers)  are  under  the
planning and conceptual phase in the 5-to-10-year planning horizon. These projects are driven by load
growth, new generation additions, and reliability needs.

MRO-SPP Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The Existing-Certain and Net Firm Transfers Reserve Margin for the SPP assessment area is projected
to fall below the current coincident summer season RML of 19% in 2027. The current summer season
reserve margin target for SPP is 15%, but that is based on the non-coincident peak demand of load-
responsible entities (LRE) in the SPP assessment area. For purposes of NERC assessments, the 15%
target is converted, along with forecasted demand values, to an SPP coincident peak representation
based  on  the  latest  calculated  diversity  factor.  This  results  in  an  RML  of  19%.  Based  on  resources
submitted in the ARM calculation, including the impact of retirements, SPP is forecasted to be above
the 19% RML for the 10-year horizon.

Like the generation unavailability scenario in NERC’s 2024 Summer Reliability Assessment, SPP shows
the potential to utilize all the current projected capacity and there could be times of capacity shortfall
based on performance impacts during high-load periods. While the potential to all available capacity
has a lower probability, the assumptions and projections are based around historical unavailability
during  peak  periods.  Current  LTRA  projections  are  based  on  the  latest  resource  adequacy  data
submittals, which are provided by the LREs and Generator Owners in SPP.

SPP performs a biennial LOLE study to establish a reserve margin target such that the LOLE for the
applicable planning year (3- and 6-year study) does not exceed 1 day in 10 years, or 0.1 day per year.
The target is determined using probabilistic methods by altering capacity through the application of
generator forced outages and forecasted demand with load uncertainty to ensure that the LOLE does
not exceed 0.1 day per year.

SPP’s 2023 LOLE study results indicate that separate PRMs and capacity requirements are needed for
the summer and winter seasons to recognize the seasonal balance of risk. Also, as colder temperature
outages increase with the incorporation of additional wind and solar resources, the loss-of-load risk
shifts to the winter season. Due to the shift in seasonal risk, it would be appropriate to consider a
maximum  LOLE  threshold  for  the  winter  season  or  incorporation  of  an  EUE  reliability  metric  to
complement the LOLE metric.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
As the resource mix continues to change from a standard base load conventional thermal and hydro
resources  to  VERs  and  short-term  energy  storage  resources  (ESR),  SPP  is  incorporating  energy
adequacy metrics (i.e., EUE) in the determination of PRMs, RMLs, additional reliability policies, and
resource accreditation enhancements.

SPP  will  begin  performing  a  yearly  energy  adequacy  assessment  and  assessment  of  reliability
attributes (inertia, primary frequency response, ramp, regulation, contingency reserves, voltage and
reactive support capability, fuel assurance, flexibility, and blackstart capability). Results of the analysis
will be presented annually to SPP stakeholders. The results will also be used to identify needs for new
market  products,  changes  to  market  functionality,  or  changes  to  resource  adequacy  policies  and
requirements.

The 2024 ProbA performed for the NERC LTRA used assumptions and methods that reflect SPP’s Loss
of LOLE studies. Results are shown in the following table.

With the current SPP fleet, there was no loss of load for the 2026 study that included Tier 1 resource
additions and 600 MW in generator retirements. The 2028 analysis included both Tier 1 and Tier 2
resource additions and 2,700 MW in generator retirements. The result was a small amount of EUE
(6.61MWh) and LOLH (0.01hr/year). The loss of load/hour occurred mostly during the summer season
(0.007hr/yr),  while  the  winter  season  had  0.0004hr/yr.  SPP  is  a  summer-peaking  region,  and  the
results  also  supported  that.  The  demand  was  highest  in  the  afternoons  between  13:00  and  19:00
during July and August.

Study  improvements  for  2024  from  the  previous  NERC  ProbAs  include  additional  weather  years,
seasonal forced-outage modeling, and incremental cold weather outages.

SPP uses the Strategic Energy & Risk Valuation Model (SERVM) for the ProbA. It is a production-cost
modeling tool that uses the Monte Carlo method to solve LOLE. Each weather year was simulated 300
times to simulate a multitude of random forced outage draws. Taking 300 draws for each weather
year (43) and multiplying by 8,760 hours gets to a total of over 113 million simulated hours, from 1980
to 2022. Each iteration was performed on an 8,760-hour basis.

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
57

The  study  input  model  consisted  of  multiple  modeling  assumptions  including  multiple  historical
weather years (1980–2022); hourly load, solar, and wind profiles; load forecast uncertainty; random
forced  outages  draws  and  variability;  physical  and  economic  resource  parameters;  resource
retirements; future resource additions; zonal transmission limitations; and incremental conventional
resource forced outages due to extreme cold temperature.

The generating resources modeled in  the Probabilistic Assessment reflect the data supplied in  the
2024 LTRA. Existing and projected resources were included in the Probabilistic Assessment along with
reported  confirmed  retirements.  As  mentioned  previously,  wind  and  solar  resources,  as  well  as
historical weather years, were modeled at historical hourly values using 2012 to 2022 weather years.
There were six study zones, and SPP modeled a projected 8,760 hourly demand profile for each area
to provide load variability and volatility for chronological hours during simulation. Each local resource
zone was modeled with an import and export limit based on a separate power flow transfer analysis.
SPP used unit-specific outage rates within the analysis based on NERC Generation Availability Data
System (GADS) data from 2015 to 2022. External assistance only included firm contracts from external
entities with firm transmission service.

Demand
SPP peak load occurs during the summer season; the 2024 net internal demand forecast is projected
to peak at 53,094 MW, which is projected to increase compared to the previous year’s LTRA forecast
for the 2022 summer season. The diversity factor used to convert the non-coincident peak demand
forecast to an SPP coincident  peak  demand forecast was consistent with the ~3.5% applied in the
2023 LTRA. SPP forecasts the coincident annual peak growth based on member submitted data over
the 10-year assessment timeframe. One risk that SPP has noted is that the aggregated noncoincident
demand forecast submitted by members in recent years, which is based on a 50/50 forecast and is
weather normalized, is tracking at a lower demand level than what the BA has observed.

Demand-Side Management
SPP’s energy efficiency (EE) and conservation programs are incorporated into the reporting entities’
demand  forecasts.  There  are  no  known  impacts  to  the  SPP  assessment  area’s  long-term  reliability
related  to  the  forecasted  increase  in  EE  and  DR  across  the  assessment  area.  In  addition,  SPP  is
constructing a new policy to more appropriately categorize DR based on the flexibility of the program,
which will ultimately be reflected in the accreditation process.

Distributed Energy Resources
The SPP Model Development, Economic Studies, and Supply Adequacy working groups are developing
policies  and  procedures  around  DERs.  SPP  resource  adequacy  implemented  policies  for  DERs  that
mandate  certain  testing,  reporting,  and  document  requirements  for  resources  and  programs  not

registered in the SPP Integrated Market. Accreditation methodology policies are being constructed
and are planned to be approved in late 2024.

Generation
SPP  currently  has  approximately  900  MW  of  installed  solar  generating  facilities.  In  the  ARM
calculation,  SPP  is  reporting  nameplate  capacity  of  approximately  11  GW  of  Tier  1,  2,  and  3  wind
resources, approximately 18 GW of Tier 1, 2, and 3 solar resources, approximately 9.8 GW of Tier 1,
2, and 3 battery resources and approximately 2.7 GW of Tier 1, 2, and 3 gas resources.

In 2024, SPP filed conventional based performance accreditation and effective load carrying capability
(ELCC) methodology for wind and solar resources. The goal is for these policies to become effective in
the 2026/2027 timeframe for both the summer and winter seasons.

There are concerns of drought conditions impacting the Missouri River and other water sources for
generation  resources  that  rely  on  once-through  cooling  processes. Low  water  can  impact  the
generation’s capacity output and reduce its ability to support congestion management and serve load.
An additional concern could be the impact of river conditions on coal shipments, which could cause
generators to run at a derated level to conserve supplies.

Energy Storage
Currently, SPP is studying approximately 17,000 MWs of energy storage and hybrid resource projects
in the generator interconnection queue process. There are approximately 50 MWs of energy storage
under contract by SPP members. These resources are being modeled as generation in the planning
assumptions both near and long term.

Capacity Transfers
The  SPP  assessment  area  coordinates  with  neighboring  areas  to  ensure  that  adequate  transfer
capabilities will be available for capacity transfers. On an annual basis during the model build season,
SPP staff coordinate the modeling of transfers between Planning Coordinator footprints. The modeled
transactions are fed into the models created for the SPP planning process.

SPP and ERCOT executed a Coordination Plan that superseded the prior coordination agreement. The
Coordination  Plan  addresses  operational  issues  for  coordination  of  the  dc  ties  between  the  Texas
Interconnection and Eastern Interconnection, block load transfers (BLT), and switchable generation
resources (SWGR). Under the terms of the Coordination Plan, SPP has priority to recall the capacity of
any SWGRs that have been committed to satisfying the resource adequacy requirements contained
in Attachment AA of the SPP Open Access Transmission Tariff. Annually, SPP and ERCOT update the

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
58

Coordination Plan based on the latest discussions and business decisions, and it was updated in June
2024.

Transmission
In  the  2023  ITP  Assessment,  SPP  approved  44  transmission  projects,  including  150  miles  of  new
transmission. Additionally, the study calls for 93 miles of transmission to be rebuilt.
SPP is observing a number of transmission projects that are currently delayed. SPP is actively tracking
these projects and discussing them throughout its stakeholder process. Many delays are driven by
supply  chain  issues  or  increasing  length  of  construction  times.  The  delays  of  these  transmission
projects do not currently seem to be driving reliability issues.

assessment  area  is  20%;  however,  this  reserve  margin  is  not  mandated.  The  ARM  over  the  study
period for the Maritimes area ranges between 17% and 30% during the winter period and between
88% and 93% during the summer period.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
During off-peak hours, the Maritimes area has surplus generation and no constraints with converting
the capacity to energy.

Probabilistic Assessments
Two Balancing Authorities within the Maritimes area are members of NPCC and jointly prepare annual
probabilistic  assessments  that  cover  three-  to  five-year  forward-looking  periods  and  evaluate  the
adequacy of the Maritimes’ transmission system and resources. In addition, the Maritimes area also
supports NERC’s annual seasonal ProbAs, which provides an evaluation of generation resource and
transmission system adequacy that will be necessary to meet projected seasonal peak demands and
operating reserves. Results of the 2024 ProbA are in the table below.

The  following  table  of  LOLH  for  2028  provides  a  depiction  of  risks  across  the  calendar  year  and
highlights  the  concentration  of  risk  in  winter.  Most  load-loss  risk  occurs  in  winter  months  of
December–February, with some additional risk occurring in shoulder months. 2026 has a similar risk
distribution.

Hourly demand and resource projections for a typical risk-day in 2026 are shown in the figure below.
Expected resource contributions are observed to cover expected demand on the risk day. However,
the  greatest  risk  for  this  assessment  area  is  in  the  form  of  lower-than-expected  resource
contributions. If this were to occur, expected demand for all hours would not be met. This risk would
be  exaggerated  by  the  addition  of  a  higher-than-expected  demand  event.  Reliance  on  external
assistance may be necessary in these events. A risk day in 2028 has a similar profile.

exist. During the 10-year LTRA assessment period in the Maritimes area, annual amounts for summer
peak demand reductions associated with EE and conservation programs rise from 20 MW to 169 MW
while the annual amounts for winter peak demand reductions rise from 168 MW to 629 MW.34

Distributed Energy Resources
The  DER  installed  capacity  in  NS  is  approximately  245  MW  at  present,  including  distribution-
connected wind projects under purchase power agreements, small community wind projects under a
feed-in tariff, and BTM solar.

LTRA wind capacity for NB, NS, and PEI is derated between 18% and 33% using probabilistic methods
to  calculate  equivalent  perfect  capacities  for  each  sub-area  excluding  NM,  which  uses  seasonal
capacity factors. BTM solar is assumed to have an ELCC of 0% during winter period. The Maritimes
area has shown embedded BTM solar PV projections of 149 MW in 2024 rising to 881 MW by 2034.
These projects include distributed small-scale solar (mainly rooftop) that fall under the net metering
program and serve as a reduction in load mainly in the residential class. The forecasted increase in
solar  installations  in  the  coming  years  is  a  result  of  initiatives  including  municipal  and  provincial
incentive programs. There is no capacity contribution from solar generation due to the timing of the
area’s system peak, which occurs either before sunrise or after sunset in the winter period.

Generation
NB assumes extending 28 MW of diesel-fired generator starting in 2025 and recently upgraded 290
MW of natural-gas-fueled resource completed in 2023. There are 25.2 MW of wind power purchase
agreements (PPA) also slated to start in 2025. An anticipated replacement PPA contract, a long-term
firm energy contract from a neighboring jurisdiction, and opportunities to buy in day-ahead and real-
time markets will be utilized to maintain the overall resource adequacy.

NB Tier 1 resources include 71 MW of wind and 400 MW of combustion turbines. Tier 2 resources
include 200 MW of wind resources and Tier 3 includes 400 MW of wind.

In NS, Tier 1 resources include wind projects with a total nameplate capacity of 473 MW phased in
from 2024–2027 with an ELCC of 10%, 150 MW battery storage, 4 MW tidal power, 2 MW biomass
unit, and a small 0.14 MW solar farm. Tier 2 resources in NS include 250 MW of battery storage (2026–
2032), 600 MW of combustion turbines (2027–2033), a 150 MW conversion of a coal-fired unit to
natural gas (2028), 450 MW in conversion of coal-fire units to oil (2030), 220 MW of solar generation,

Demand
There  is  no  regulatory  requirement  for  a  single  authority  to  produce  a  forecast  for  the  whole
Maritimes area. The peak area demand occurs in winter and is highly reliant on the forecasts of the
two  largest  sub-areas  of  NB  and  NS,  which  are  historically  highly  coincidental.  Demand  for  the
Maritimes  area  is  determined  to  be  the  non-coincident  sum  of  the  peak  loads  forecasted  by  the
individual sub-areas. The aggregated growth of both demand and energy for the combined sub-areas
see an upward trend over summer and winter seasonal periods of the LTRA assessment period. The
area peak loads are expected to increase by 4.2% during summer and by 6.4% during winter seasons
over the 10-year assessment period. This translates to compound average growth rates of 0.4% in
summer and 0.6% in winter. The Maritimes Area annual energy forecasts are expected to increase by
a total of 5.9% during the 10-year assessment period for an average growth of 0.6% per year.

Demand-Side Management
Plans to develop up to 100 MW by 2030/2031 of controllable direct load control programs using smart
grid  technology  to  selectively  interrupt  space  and/or  water  heater  systems  in  residential  and
commercial facilities are underway but no specific annual demand and energy saving targets currently

34 Current and projected energy efficiency effects based on actual and forecasted customer adoption of various DSM programs with differing levels of impact are incorporated directly into the load forecast for each of the areas but are not separately itemized
in the forecasts. Since controllable space and water heaters will be interrupted via smart meters, the savings attributed to these programs will be directly and immediately measurable.

and 416 MW of wind generation. Tier 3 resources in NS include natural gas additions (combustion
turbines) of 50 MW in 2029 and new wind generation with a nameplate capacity of 850 MW phased
in  from  2026–2033.  These  Tier  3  resource  additions  are  anticipated  to  facilitate  the  retirement  of
additional coal-fired generation by 2030. However, these retirements have not been included in the
assessment due to their uncertainty.

Small amounts of new solar generation capacity (Tier 1) of up to 21 MW were being installed in PEI in
2024, along with 10 MW of new hybrid energy storage (Tier 1).  PEI also has 30 MW of Tier 2 wind,
111  MW  Tier  3  wind,  and  140  MW  of  Tier  3  petroleum-based  generation  and  10  MW  of  Tier  3
batteries.

NB derates its wind capacity using a calculated year-round equivalent capacity of 22%. NS and PEI
derate  wind  capacity  to  18%  and  17%,  respectively,  of  nameplate  based  on  year-round  calculated
equivalent  load  carrying  capabilities  for  their  respective  individual  sub  areas.  The  peak  capacity
contribution  of  grid-based  solar  is  estimated  at  zero  since  the  Maritimes  area  peak  occurs  in  the
winter either before sunrise or after sunset.

Energy Storage
NS Power includes a 150 MW (4-hour duration) nameplate standalone battery resource as a Tier 1
resource and a 250 MW (4-hour duration) nameplate capacity standalone battery resource added as
a  Tier  2  resource  phased  in  from  2026  through  2032.  This  grid-scale  project  will  support  the
integration  of  new  renewable  generation,  provide  energy  arbitrage  and  resiliency  services,  and
provide firm capacity and fuel savings.

PEI includes a 10 MW nameplate capacity hybrid energy storage as a Tier 1 resource starting summer
of  2024  and  another  10  MW  nameplate  capacity  energy  storage  system  as  a  Tier  3  resource.  This
project will provide a storage option for the output from the 10 MW solar facility that is planned to

come  online  during  the  same  time  frame.  This  project  will  provide  fuel  savings  and  may  assist  in
providing additional reliability if a generation outage occurs.
NB Power has not included any energy storage resources in the 2024 LTRA submission; however, the
value of energy storage options is expected to increase as the technology improves and as NB’s smart
grid  network  develops.  NB  Power  issued  a  request  for  expressions  of  interest  for  new  renewable
generation sources including 200 MW of wind, 15 MW of solar, 5 MW of tidal, and 50 MW of 4-hour
duration  battery  storage  in  February  2023.  Under  this  program,  NB  Power  expects  uptake  in  new
energy  storage  projects  in  the  coming  years.  Internal  pilot  projects  and  studies  are  underway  to
understand  the  economics,  application,  and  performance  of  battery  storage  resources.  Ongoing
internal  analyses  are  conducted  by  NB  Power  to  determine  the  cost  and  benefit  associated  with
battery  storage  options  and  dispatching  these  resources  to  reduce/shift  peaks  and/or  balance
intermittent resources, such as wind, to provide additional flexibility to the system.

Capacity Transfers
ProbA studies show that the Maritimes area is not reliant on inter-area capacity transfers to meet
NPCC resource adequacy criteria.

Transmission
NS has multiple new transmission line projects compared to the 2023 LTRA; most being shorter runs
to enable the connection of renewable resources, with one major project of 165 miles designed to
improve the reliability of the existing tie between NS and NB.

Reliability Issues
The  Maritimes  area  has  a  diversified  mix  of  capacity  resources  fueled  by  oil,  coal,  hydro,  nuclear,
natural gas, wind (derated), dual fuel oil/gas, tie benefits, and biomass with no single one type feeding
more than about 27% of the total capacity in the area. The Maritimes area does not anticipate fuel
disruptions that pose significant challenges for resources during this assessment period.

Highlights

•  New England is forecast to have sufficient ARMs to meet consumer demand for electric energy for the first five years (2025–2029) of the assessment period and not require any Tier 2 resources.

•

ISO-NE is addressing the issues brought on by grid transformation through several planning, operational, and market measures. A significant project is the redesign of the capacity market from a forward,
annual auction to a prompt, seasonal auction with resource accreditation. The Capacity Auction Reforms (CAR) project began in Q2 2024 and is expected to be in place for the 19th Capacity Commitment
Period (CCP 19) beginning on June 1, 2028. Additionally, New England has made tariff modifications to its Longer-Term Transmission Planning process to facilitate the New England states’ achievement of
their policy-based goals by enabling the development of transmission infrastructure. ISO-NE is also working with regional stakeholders to develop a regional energy shortfall threshold (REST) that defines the
region’s tolerance for energy shortfalls during low-probability extreme weather conditions.

NPCC-New England Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
ISO-NE’s installed capacity requirement (ICR) is based on the capacity needed to meet the ISO-NE and
NPCC resource adequacy reliability criterion of an LOLE of 0.1 day/year. The ICR varies from year to
year depending on projected system conditions. The ICR is calculated on an annual basis, in advance
of the capacity auctions for each Capacity Commitment Period. The latest ICR calculations result in an
annual RML of 12.70% in 2025, 11.82% in 2026, and 11.33% in 2027, expressed in terms of the annual
50/50 peak demand forecast published in the 2024 Capacity, Energy, Loads, and Transmission (CELT)
Report.  For  the  years  2028  through  2034,  which  are  beyond  the  current  forward  capacity  market
timeframe,  ISO-NE  continued  to  use  the  last  available  RML  value  of  11.33%.  The  ISO-NE  RML  is
relatively  low  compared  to  other  regions  due  to  the  impact  of  reflecting  external  assistance  from
neighboring control areas and the continued increase in BTM solar facilities.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, and Probabilistic-Based Assessments
ISO-NE  routinely  prepares  21-day  energy  forecasts.  These  forecasts
incorporate  weather,
transmission  topology,  resource  capability  and  availability,  fuel  inventories  and  constraints,  and
projected imports/exports. If the forecasted regional supply/demand balance is negative, projected
energy deficiencies can trigger energy alerts or energy emergencies that are then disseminated to
market  participants  and  federal  and  state  regulators.  This  early  notification  of  potential  energy
shortfalls is expected to inform market participants such that actions can be taken to increase the
expected availability of generating resources as needed.

ISO-NE  recently  completed  work  with  the  Electric  Power  Research  Institute  (EPRI)  to  develop  the
Probabilistic Energy Adequacy Tool (PEAT) framework. This tool is a framework that has three major
steps (weather modeling, risk screening/scenario generation, and 21-day energy assessment), which
were subsequently applied to assess the summers and winters of 2027 and 2032.

Probabilistic Assessments
ISO-NE conducts probabilistic resource adequacy assessments annually in conjunction with NPCC to
identify regional capacity resource needs and to comply with NPCC/NERC reliability requirements. In
the  transmission  assessment  domain,  revisions  to  ISO-NE  planning  processes  reflect  the  changing
resource  characteristics,  probabilistic  study  assumptions,  and  changes  to  national  and  regional
criteria. Coordinated planning activities with neighboring systems will continue and help support the
New England states’ policy objectives of providing access to a greater diversity of clean resources to
meet environmental compliance obligations. Results from the 2024 ProbA, shown in the table below,
reveal a slight increase in load-loss and unserved energy risk from the 2022 analysis, but values remain
small.  ISO-NE  is  considered  to  have  sufficient  resources  for  the  planning  horizon  to  meet  NPCC
resource adequacy criteria.

NPCC’s  ProbA  results  indicate  that  the  risk  of  unserved  energy  in  New  England  is  concentrated  in
summer months (June–August).

Hourly demand and resource projections for a typical summer risk day in 2026 are shown in the figure
below. Although expected resource contributions meet expected demand, there is risk that above-
normal peak demand could exceed resources. Demand could be 25–30% higher than expected, which
could cause strain on the system from the hours beginning 10:00 a.m. through 10:00 p.m. Also, below-
normal  resource  performance  from  unexpected  generator  outages  or  low  solar  output  could  also
cause supply shortfalls. If resource contributions are less than expected, strain on the system could
be seen from the hour beginning 12:00 p.m. through 7:00 p.m. on a typical peak day. Reliance on
external assistance may be necessary in these extreme conditions. A risk day in 2028 has a similar
profile.

Fuel availability during extreme winter conditions is a persistent reliability concern in New England
that is not modeled in detail in the ProbA. Potential natural gas transportation constraints can affect
supply to generators during extreme cold temperatures, when natural gas demand for space heating
is  also  peaking.  Most  natural-gas-fired  generators  in  the  area  do  not  have  firm  natural  gas
transportation service and can be subject to supply curtailment during peak conditions. Many natural-
gas-fired generators in New England can also operate with stored oil, providing for assured electricity
supply  in  extreme  winter  conditions  while  oil  stores  are  procured  and  maintained.  Scenarios  of
extended and extreme cold weather that affect the availability of natural gas and oil replenishments
present a reliability risk and were not modeled in the 2024 ProbA.

Demand
Over the 10-year LTRA planning horizon, the forecast net internal summer peak demand increases by
2,988  MW  from  24,579  MW  in  2025  to  27,567  MW  in  2034  (roughly  2%  decrease  from  the  2023
forecast in the later years). The corresponding net internal winter peak demand increases by 7,342
MW from 20,639 MW in 2025–2026 to 27,981 MW in 2034–2035 (roughly a 2.5% decrease from the
2023 forecast). Net energy for load is forecast to grow by 24,701 GWh from 119,285 GWh in 2025 to
143,986 GWh in 2034 (roughly 10% decrease from the 2023 forecast). The changes from the 2023
forecast were in part due to continued enhancements of the heating and transportation electrification
forecasts.

The  higher  winter  peak  growth  rate  due  to  anticipated  electrification  results  in  significant
convergence with summer peak projections by the end of the 10-year period, such that New England’s
transition to a winter-peaking system is currently anticipated by the mid-2030s. It is also expected
that the timing of the peaks will likely occur in the morning by this time, with heating electrification
in  particular  inducing  a  greater  tendency  for  morning  peaks  due  to  electrified  residential  and
commercial heating.

Demand-Side Management
For  the  summer  of  2025,  ISO-NE  forecasts  566  MW  of  controllable  and  dispatchable demand-side
management (DSM) resources, and that amount is projected to decrease by 22 MW to 544 MW by
2034.  For  the  summer  of  2025,  ISO-NE  forecasts  1,873  MW  of  passive  DSM  resources  (EE  and
conservation). Demand-side resources are projected to peak in 2030 at 2,117 MW and then begin to
decrease  to  1,978  MW  by  2034.  This  decrease  in  the  later  years  is  due  to  expiring  EE  measures
outpacing new passive DSM additions.

Distributed Energy Resources
For summer months, the BTM PV forecast is incorporated as estimated reductions to the ISO-NE gross
demand  forecast.  In  2025,  New  England  forecasts  1,141  MW  of  peak  load  reduction  (4,533  MW

nameplate) of BTM PV. BTM PV is forecast to grow to 1,299 MW of peak load reduction (8,217 MW
nameplate) by 2034. The BTM PV peak load reduction values are calculated as a percentage of ac
nameplate. The percentages include the effect of diminishing PV production at the time of the system
peak  as  increasing  PV  penetrations  shift  the  timing  of  peaks  later  in  the  day.  The  BTM  peak  load
reduction decreases from 25.2% of nameplate in 2025 to 15.8% in 2034.

ISO-NE  recently  adopted  a  new  planning  procedure  (PP12)  to  formalize  and  standardize  data
collection for DERs. Under this procedure, distribution providers would be responsible for providing
installation-level data on DERs connected to their system. Additionally, transmission providers would
be responsible for providing basic data to translate feeder IDs into substation names and other useful
identifying  information.  Among  the  other  benefits  that  this  procedure  will  lead  to  is  “proper
accounting for the location, size, and type of DER which will lead to more accurate study outcomes.”

Generation
The largest change that will impact New England’s generation fleet is ISO-NE’s CARs.

Specifically, to better ensure power system reliability and cost efficiency as New England’s resource
mix  evolves,  ISO-NE  is  proposing  a  CAR  that  would  transition  the  capacity  market  from  a
forward/annual market to a prompt/seasonal market with accreditation reforms. This initiative has
three  primary  components  that  would  be  in  place  for  the  Capacity  Commitment  Period  (CCP)
scheduled to start on June 1, 2028.

•  Prompt auction: Instead of taking place three years in advance, the capacity auction would
take  place  shortly  before  the  CCP,  reflecting  more  accurate  information  about  projected
electricity supply and demand.

•  Seasonal CCP: The CCP changes from annual to sub-annual (seasonal) commitment periods to
better address the distinct reliability challenges of winter and summer, as well as variations
in resource performance from season to season.

•  Accreditation reforms: Work began in 2022 via the former “Resource Capacity Accreditation
in the Forward Capacity Market” project to identify and implement methodologies that will
more accurately reflect resource contributions to resource adequacy in the capacity market.
It  is  critical  to  the  reliable  and  efficient  clean-energy  transition  that  the  accreditation
methodologies  are  updated  to  reflect  resources’  capabilities  and  how  those  capabilities
contribute  to  resource  adequacy.  This  work  continues  through  CAR  in  the  context  of  the
proposed market constructs.

In  addition,  transmission  improvements  will  also  be  needed  to  support  state  policies  to  access
remotely located sources of clean energy and serve increased load as transportation and heating are
electrified. Transmission assessments and resultant plans are being developed throughout the region
to meet these future system needs.

Energy Storage
New  England  currently  has  a  total  of  1,899  MW  of  energy  storage  capacity.  This  number  includes
about 39 MW of battery storage (BESS) and hybrid solar/battery storage. The largest energy storage
resource(s)  in  New  England  are  three  pumped-storage  hydro-electric  facilities  that  can  supply  a
combined 1,860 MW of quick-start 10-minute operating reserve capability, and with full reservoirs,
and can deliver over 11,800 MWh of energy to the BPS.

Over  the  next  five  years  (2025–2029),  the  nameplate  capacity  of  energy  storage  devices  (BESS,
integrated-hybrid, and co-located-hybrid) are projected to increase significantly (Tier #1 [1,607 MW],
Tier #2 [5,047 MW], and Tier #3 [4,955 MW]). No new pumped-storage facilities are planned for the
region.  Over  the  next  10  years,  those  total  Tier  1–3  capacities  do  not  increase  from  the  five-year
projection. All the above capacity totals reflect summer seasonal claimed capability ratings.

Capacity Transfers
New England is interconnected with the three BAs of Québec, the Maritimes, and New York. ISO-NE
considers the tie benefits associated with these BAs within its capacity market methodology to reduce
the  installed  capacity  requirement  to  meet  the  regional  resource  adequacy  criterion.  Assumed
assistance from tie benefits ranges from 1,830 MW in 2025 to 2,115 MW in 2027. Aside from such
assistance, ISO-NE’s firm capacity imports are projected to range from a maximum of 1,248 MW in
the summer of 2025 down to 465 MW in the summer of 2027. There is one long-term firm import
contract of 84 MW that extends through the summers of 2028 through 2032. There are currently no
firm  imports  projected  for  the  summers  of  2033  and  2034.  In  addition,  there  are  no  firm  exports
identified over the 10-year assessment.

Transmission
Transmission expansion in New England has improved the overall level of reliability and resiliency,
reduced  air  emissions,  and  lowered  wholesale  market  costs  by  nearly  eliminating  congestion.
Generator retirements, off-peak system needs, the growth of DERs and VERs using IBRs, and changes
to mandatory planning criteria promulgated by NERC, NPCC, and regional stakeholders have driven
the need for longer-term transmission assessments.

The future reliable and economic performance of the BPS is expected to be maintained as a result of
approximately  $1.5  billion  of  planned  transmission  upgrades  over  the  next  10  years.  Generator
retirements, the integration of many DERs and VERs, the use of IBR technologies, and issues rising
from minimum load assessments and high-voltage conditions are changing the needs for reliability-
based transmission upgrades. Interregional import capability will also increase with the completion
of  the  1,200  MW  HVdc  New  England  Clean  Energy  Connect  (NECEC)  tie  line  between  Québec  and
Maine, scheduled to be in service by the beginning of 2026.

Reliability Issues
New  England’s  BPS  is  transitioning  to  a  system  with  unprecedented  demand  growth,  due  to
electrification  of  heating  and  transportation,  and  a  growing  number  of  renewables,  clean  energy
resources,  VERs,  and  DERs.  ISO-NE  is  engaged  in  the  implementation  of  revised  interconnection
standards  for  VERs  and  DERs  that  will  ensure  overall  BPS  reliability  and  facilitate  the  economic
development of IBRs.

ISO-NE has observed some delays in projected in service dates for system upgrades due to supply
chain issues. In these cases, ISO-NE develops operating plans to work around any issues caused by
these delays. Additionally, the New England Transmission Owners have indicated that supply chain
issues are causing a notable increase in project costs.

New England has already experienced constraints on electric energy production due to constraints on
fuel infrastructure that have an impact on the power sector during winter. In response, ISO-NE has
been a key player at the national level in promoting BPS reliability through sharing of lessons learned,
best  practices,  and,  more  recently,  through  the  performance  of  more  detailed  and  in-depth  BPS
energy assessments. Additionally, to address winter energy security challenges, ISO-NE and regional
stakeholders developed and put in place a two-year program to compensate certain resources that
provide  energy  security  during  the  winters  of  2023–2024  and  2024–2025  (from  December  to
February).  ISO-NE’s  Inventoried  Energy  Program  (IEP)  is  a  voluntary  program  designed  to  provide
incremental, winter-period compensation for participants that maintain inventoried energy for their
assets during extreme cold periods when energy security is most stressed.

The just-in-time delivery of a generator’s fuel supply, whether natural gas, wind, or solar, is creating
the need for the electric sector to quickly develop ways to retain access to flexible, stored energy—
either through long-term energy storage solutions that can capture and store renewable power or
through the use of dispatchable resources.

ISO-NE is actively working on numerous major projects to prepare for the clean energy transition and
ensure  continued  reliability.  The  following  is  a  short  list  of  major  projects  in  which  ISO-NE  has
engaged:

•  CAR Project

•  Operational Impacts of Extreme Weather Events

•  Regional Energy Shortfall Threshold

•  Day-Ahead Ancillary Services Initiative

•  Economic Planning for the Clean Energy Transition (EPCET)

•  Extended-Term Transmission Planning Tariff Changes

NPCC-New York
NPCC-New York is an assessment area consisting of the New York ISO (NYISO) service territory. NYISO is responsible for operating New York’s BPS, administering wholesale electricity markets,
and conducting system planning. NYISO is the only Balancing Authority within the state of New York. The BPS encompasses over 11,000 miles of transmission lines and 760 power generation
units and serves 20.2 million customers. For this LTRA, the established RML is 15%. Wind, grid-connected solar, and run-of-river totals were derated for this calculation. However, New York
requires load-serving entities to procure capacity for their loads equal to their peak demand plus an Installed Reserve Margin (IRM). The IRM requirement represents a percentage of capacity
above peak load forecast and is approved annually by the New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC). The NYSRC approved the 2025–2026 IRM at 24.4%.

Highlights

•  Public policies, such as New York state’s 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), are driving rapid changes in New York’s electric system, impacting how electricity is produced,
transmitted,  and  consumed.  The  transition  to  a  cleaner  grid  in  New  York  is  leading  to  an  electric  system  that  will  be  increasingly  dynamic,  decentralized,  and  reliant  on  weather-dependent  renewable
generation.

•  Recent assessments reveal that reliability margins are shrinking. Electrification programs are increasing the demand for electricity and placing New York on a trajectory to be a winter-peaking system in the
future. Largely in response to public policies, fossil fuel generators are retiring at a faster pace than new renewable supply is entering service. The potential for delays in construction of new supply and
transmission, higher than forecasted demand, and extreme weather could threaten reliability and resilience of the New York grid.

•  NYISO’s reliability studies identified actionable reliability needs starting 2025 in New York City. The reliability need is primarily driven by a combination of forecasted increases in peak demand and the assumed
unavailability of certain generation in New York City affected by state legislation and regulations promulgated by the New York State Department of Environmental Conversation, commonly known as the
Peaker Rule,36 to limit emissions. Following a solicitation for proposed solutions to the reliability need, NYISO retained several plants in New York City that would have otherwise been deactivated to comply
with the Peaker Rule.  NYISO’s 2024 Reliability Needs Assessment (RNA), targeting completion in the fourth quarter of 2024, identifies transmission security violations of reliability criteria primarily driven by
a combination of forecasted increases in peak demand, limited additional supply, and the assumed retirement of generation in New York City in response to state law and regulations.

•  Driven by public polices, new supply, large loads, and transmission projects are seeking to interconnect to the grid at record levels. NYISO’s interconnection process balances developer needs with grid
reliability. Efforts are underway to make this process more efficient while protecting grid reliability. New transmission is being built, but more investment is necessary to support the delivery of offshore wind
energy and to connect new resources upstate to downstate load centers where demand is greatest. Planning for new transmission to support offshore wind is underway in NYISO’s Public Policy Transmission
Planning Process.

•  To achieve the mandates of the CLCPA, new dispatchable emission-free resources (DEFR) with the necessary reliability services will be needed to replace the capabilities and attributes of today's generation.
These types of resources, which can achieve the necessary attributes by a combination of solutions, must be significant in capacity and have attributes similar to traditional generation plants, such as the
ability to come on-line quickly, stay on-line for as long as needed, maintain the system’s balance and stability, provide ERSs, and adapt to meet rapid, steep ramping needs. Such new emission-free supply is
not yet available on a commercial scale.

•  New wholesale electricity market rules are supporting the grid in transition. These markets are critical for a reliable transition. Wholesale electricity markets are open to significant investment in wind, solar,
and battery storage as well as distributed energy resources. Demand management programs are also under development as a measure to facilitate achievement of CLCPA targets. By lowering the peak load
and avoiding system buildout to serve the highest demand hour, fewer DEFRs will be needed and fewer fossil fuel-fired plants will be needed to meet lower peaks during the transition.

NPCC-New York Assessment
Planning Reserve Margins
The LTRA anticipated and prospective margins are above 15% with the exception of year 9 (2033) and
year 10 (2034). However, the system margins are narrowing throughout the assessment period. Wind,
grid-connected solar, and run-of-river totals were derated for the LTRA calculation. Under its reliability
planning processes, NYISO uses probabilistic assessments to evaluate its system’s resource adequacy
against the LOLE resource adequacy criterion of no greater than 0.1 event-days/year probability of
unplanned  load  loss.  NYISO’s  2024  Reliability  Needs  Assessment,  which  is  underway  and  targets
completion in Q4 2024, will likely identify reliability criteria violations.

NYISO also provides support to the NYSRC in conducting an annual IRM study. This study determines
the IRM for the upcoming capability year (May 1 through April 30). The IRM is used to quantify the
capacity required to meet the NPCC and NYSRC resource adequacy criterion of “1 day in 10 years.”
The current IRM for the 2024–2025 capability year is 22% of the forecasted NYCA peak load. All values
in the IRM calculation are based upon full installed capacity values of resources. The IRM has varied
historically  from  15%  to  22%.  Additionally,  the  NYISO  performs  an  annual  study  to  identify  the
locational minimum installed capacity requirements (LCR) for the upcoming capability year.

Energy Assessment, Including Non-Peak Hour Risk
New York State’s CLCPA mandates to decarbonize span over all major industries and are a main driver
for the electric system changes. NYISO staff in system operations, planning, and markets will continue
to assess the system changes to prepare for the grid’s transformation.

With  high  penetration  of  renewable  intermittent  resources,  the  system  will  need  dispatchable
emission-free  resources  (DEFR)  and  long-duration  resources  to  balance  intermittent  supply  with
demand.  These  types  of  resources  must  be  significant  in  capacity  and  have  attributes  such  as  the
ability to come on-line quickly, stay on-line for as long as needed, maintain the system’s balance and
stability, and adapt to meet rapid, steep ramping needs. Additionally, although new transmission is
being built, more investment is necessary to support the delivery of future offshore wind energy and
to connect new resources upstate to downstate load centers where demand is greatest.

NYISO performs long-range assessments (10-year and beyond planning horizon), and certain energy
aspects  are  accounted  for  in  the  hourly  modeling  and  simulations  performed  under  the  resource
adequacy  studies  through  NYISO’s  reliability  planning  processes  along  with  the  production  cost
simulations performed under its System and Resource Outlook.

NYISO performs and supports energy assessments, including a fuel and energy security study, a study
assessing potential impacts related to climate change, and weekly analysis of fuel and energy security

based on load profiles and fuel inventories reported through NYISO’s Generator and Fuel Emissions
Reporting  (GFER)  data  portal.  These  assessments  are  based  on  data  and  information  provided  by
resources on an annual, weekly, and as-needed basis considering system operating conditions. These
assessments have the capability to analyze the impact of changes in stored fuel inventory, resource
outages,  fuel  supply  disruptions,  transmission  constraints,  and  other  relevant  conditions  that  may
adversely impact fuel and energy security. Additionally, the New York City and Long Island areas have
a  loss  of  gas  supply  dual-fuel  requirement  and  certain  combined  cycle  gas  units  participate  in  a
“Minimum Oil Burn” program. While oil accounts for a relatively small percentage of the total energy
production in New York, it is often called during critical periods, such as when severe cold weather
limits access to natural gas.

Probabilistic Assessments (NERC ProbA and Other Studies)
NYISO performs probabilistic assessments using GE’s Multi-Area Reliability Simulation (MARS) as part
of  its  reliability  planning  processes  as  well  as  to  determine  annual  IRM  LCRs.  NYISO  also  pursued
capacity  accreditation  market  rules  to  more  accurately  reflect  capacity  market  suppliers’
contributions  to  resource  adequacy.  These  new  market  rules  align  compensation  for  capacity
suppliers  with  an  individual  resource’s  expected  reliability  benefit  to  consumers  and  uses  the
probabilistic models from the LCR process to define capacity accreditation factors (CAF) for various
capacity accreditation resource classes. The groundbreaking proposal was accepted by FERC in May
2022.  The  CAFs  will  reflect  the  marginal  reliability  contribution  of  the  ICAP  Suppliers  within  each
Capacity Accreditation Resource Class toward meeting NYSRC resource adequacy requirements for
the upcoming capability year, starting with the capability year that began in May 2024.

Additionally, NPCC provides results into NERC’s ProbA process under the LTRA. The results from the
ProbA performed in 2024 by NPCC are shown below.

Most load-loss and unserved energy risk is in the summer months of late June through August.

NYISO publishes a Reliability Needs Assessment (RNA) and an annual update in the intervening year
between RNAs.

Hourly demand and resource projections for a typical summer risk day in 2026 are shown in the figure
below. Although expected resource contribution is enough to meet expected demand, there is risk
that  above-normal  peak  demand  could  exceed  resources.  Demand  could  be  10–13%  higher  than
expected, which could cause strain on the system from the hours beginning 2:00 p.m. through 11:00
p.m.  Also,  below-normal  resource  performance  from  unexpected  generator  outages  or  low-solar
output could also cause supply shortfalls. If resource contributions are less than expected, strain on
the system could be seen from hour beginning 12:00 p.m. through 12:00 a.m. on a typical peak day.
Reliance on external assistance may be necessary in these events. A risk day in 2028 has a similar
profile.

Hourly Probabilistic Assessment Results | Representative Summer Risk Day 2026

NPCC’s Directory 1 defines a compliance obligation for the NYISO, as a Resource Planner and Planning
Coordinator, to perform a resource adequacy study evaluating a five-year planning horizon. NYISO
delivers a report every year under this study process to verify the system against the 1-day-in-10-
years LOLE criterion, which is usually based on NYISO’s latest available reliability assessment results
and  assumptions.  NYSRC  Reliability  Rules  have  recently  included  a  requirement  defining  NYISO’s
obligation to deliver a Long-Term Resource Adequacy Assessment Report every year during which the

Demand
NYISO employs a multi-stage process to develop load forecasts for each of the 11 zones within the
New  York  Control  Area  (NYCA).  The  impacts  of  net  electricity  consumption  of  energy  storage
resources due to charging and discharging are added to the energy forecasts, while the peak-reducing
impacts of BTM energy storage resources are deducted from the peak forecasts.

Currently,  the  NYCA  summer  peak  typically  occurs  in  late  afternoon.  The  NYCA  summer  peak  is
projected to shift into the evening as additional BTM solar is added to the system and as EV charging
impacts  increase  during  the  evening  hours.  Because  the  hour  of  the  summer  peak  shifts  into  the
evening over the course of the forecast horizon, BTM solar generation becomes less coincident with
the NYCA peak hour, and BTM solar coincident peak reductions are forecasted to decrease in later
years.  The  forecast  of  solar  PV-related  reductions  to  the  winter  peak  is  zero  because  the  system
typically peaks after sunset.

Trended weather conditions from the Climate Impact Study Phase I report are included in NYISO’s
end-use  models  and  are  reflected  in  the  baseline,  policy  scenario,  and  percentile  forecasts.  NYISO
develops  90th  and  99th  percentile  forecasts  to  account  for  the  impacts  of  extreme  weather  on
seasonal peak  demand  and  calculates  10th  percentile forecasts to  represent  milder seasonal  peak
conditions.

The  10-year  annual  average  energy  (+1.7%)  and  summer  peak  demand  (+0.8%)  growth  rates  are
higher than last year’s forecast. Increases in growth rates relative to the prior forecast are primarily
attributed  to  the  significant  impacts  of  interconnecting  large  load  projects.  Baseline  energy  and
coincident peak demand increase significantly throughout the 30-year forecast period, driven largely
by  large  load  project  growth  in  the  early  forecast  years  and  electrification  of  space  heating,  non-
weather sensitive appliances, and EV charging in the outer forecast years. New York is projected to
become winter-peaking in future decades due to space heating electrification and EV penetration. To
account  for  forecast  uncertainty  during  winter  due  to  electrification  and  large  loads,  NYISO
implemented a winter dynamic load forecast uncertainty in the resource adequacy models for its 2024
RNA.

Demand-Side Management
NYISO is working on developing market concepts to encourage the participation of flexible load, which
will  become  increasingly  important  as  the  levels  of  weather-dependent  intermittent  resources  on
New York’s grid increase in response to the state’s climate and clean energy policies. Many of New

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
75

York’s  utilities  are  piloting  several  load  management  programs  (e.g.,  smart  EV  charging,  home-
thermostat use, and integration of BTM storage for local peak demand modulation). As part of NYISO’s
annual long-term forecasting process, the impacts of these programs are discussed and significant
impacts on demand are included in the load forecast.

DR participation for the summer capability period has increased slightly from 1,234 MW to 1,281 MW
since the 2023 LTRA. There are currently 425 MW of DR participating in ancillary services programs
and providing either 10-minute spinning reserves or 30-minute non-synchronous reserves.

Distributed Energy Resources
NYISO has implemented in 2024 a plan to integrate DERs, including DR resources, into the markets it
administers.  The  DER  Participation  Model  project  aims  to  enhance  participation  of  DERs  in  the
competitive  wholesale  markets.  These  measures  closely  align  the  bidding  and  performance
measurements  for  DERs  with  the  rules  for  generators.  The  measures  establish  a  state-of-the-art
model that is largely consistent with the market design envisioned by FERC in its Order 2222. This
project, which began in 2017, provides a single participation model for DER DR resources to provide
energy, ancillary services, and installed capacity through an aggregation. The market rules for the DER
and aggregation participation model were accepted by FERC in January 2020. NYISO filed additional
proposed tariff revisions with FERC in June 2023 to clarify and enhance these market rules. NYISO
deployed its DER participation model in 2024.

Generation
The pace of renewable project development and existing generation retirement is unprecedented and
driving a need to increase the pace of transmission expansion, clean dispatchable generation, and
demand management programs development. In general, resource and transmission expansion take
many years from development to deployment. Coordination of project additions and retirements is
essential to maintaining reliability and achieving policy. Significant new resource development will be
required to achieve energy targets under the CLCPA. The total installed generation capacity to meet
policy objectives within New York is projected to range between 111 GW and 124 GW by 2040. At
least 95 GW of this capacity will consist of new generation projects and/or modifications to existing
plants.  Even  with  these  additions,  New  York  still  may  not  be  sufficient  to  maintain  the  reliable
electricity  supply.  The  sheer  scale  of  resources  needed  to  satisfy  system  reliability  and  policy
requirements within the next 20 years is unparalleled.

Currently,  NYISO’s  interconnection  process  contains  a  significant  number  of  proposed  projects  in
various stages of development with only a fraction in more advanced stages included in the reliability
planning models. However, the grid will evolve to achieve the policy mandates, and those changes
will affect the nature and amount of resources.

For the 2024 RNA, gas availability is derated during winter to further account for cold weather risks.

To  achieve  the  CLCPA  mandate  of  an  emission-free  grid  by  2040,  DEFRs  must  be  developed  and
deployed throughout New York. DEFRs that provide sustained on-demand power and system stability
will be essential to meeting policy objectives while maintaining a reliable electric grid. While essential
to the grid of the future, such DEFR technologies are not commercially available today.

ERSs usually provided to the system by synchronous fossil generation will continue to be necessary.
New  technology  is  being  developed  to  allow  for  a  reliable  transition  to  a  clean  grid.  Grid-forming
inverter capabilities, as well as DEFRs, will likely be part of this transformation. In May 2023, the New
York State Public Service Commission (PSC) initiated a process to examine the need for resources to
ensure the reliability of the CLCPA mandate for a zero-emissions electric grid by 2040. The PSC seeks
to identify innovative technologies to ensure the reliability of a zero-emissions electric grid. Numerous
other initiatives at both state and federal levels are in progress and may impact the grid of the future.

Energy Storage
Storage  resources  can  help  to  fill  in  voids  created  by  reduced  output  from  renewable  resources.
However, sustained periods of reduced renewable generation can rapidly deplete storage capabilities.
NYISO has implemented its Co-Located Storage Resources model to allow wind or solar resources that
are interconnected with an energy storage resource the ability to participate in the markets while
respecting  a  shared  interconnection  limitation.  NYISO  is  developing  a  model  for  hybrid  storage
resources to allow multiple technologies at the same point of interconnection to participate in the
market as a single resource. Additionally, the resource adequacy simulation tools (such as GE’s MARS)
used in system planning by NYISO and for setting the IRMs were enhanced to include energy-limited
resources models that allow for charging and discharging and also include temporal constraints (e.g.,
hours/days or hours/month).

Capacity Transfers
The models used for  NYISO’s reliability planning studies include firm capacity transactions (purchases
and sales) with the neighboring systems as a base-case assumption. Proposed projects that are in a
more advanced stage are included. One such project is the 1,250 MW HVdc line from Québec to New
York  City,  which  is  reflected  in  the  LTRA  summer  total  transfers  starting  in  2026.  Additionally,  the
probabilistic model that NYISO uses to assess the adequacy of resources in the reliability planning
processes  employs  several  methods  aimed  at  preventing  overreliance  on  the  external  systems
support. For example, NYISO employs limiting emergency assistance from neighbors by modeling a
total limit of 3,500 MW, modeling five simultaneous peak days, modeling the long-term purchases
and sales with neighboring control areas, and not modeling emergency operating procedure steps for
the neighbors.

New  York  is  fortunate  to  have  strong  interconnections  with  neighboring  regions  and  has  enjoyed
reliability and economic benefits from such connections. As the energy policies in neighboring regions
evolve, New York’s imports and exports of energy could vary significantly due to the resulting changes
in neighboring grids. The availability of energy for interchange is predicted to shift fundamentally as
policy achievement progresses. As New York’s and other regions’ grids evolve, continuous monitoring
and collaboration with our neighboring states will be required.

Transmission
Significant  new  transmission  is  being  built  across  New  York,  but  more  investment  is  necessary  to
support, among other things, the delivery of offshore wind energy to connect new resources upstate
to downstate load centers where demand is greatest.

Key transmission projects under development and accounted for in the reliability models include the
following:

•  The Northern New York Priority Transmission Project upgrading the transmission corridors

from the renewable generation pocket in the north country to central New York

•  The 1,250 MW Champlain-Hudson Power Express HVdc line from Hydro-Québec to New York

City

•  The AC Public Policy Transmission Projects that consist of upgrading transmission corridors in
central  New  York  and  the  lower  Hudson  Valley,  which  projects  target  completion  of  the
majority of the components by December 2023

•  The  transmission  project  selected  to  address  the  Long  Island  Offshore  Wind  Expert  Public
Policy Transmission Need and that adds three new dc tie lines and a 345 kV backbone across
western/central Long Island with an in-service date in 2030

Additionally, there are significant transmission projects either recently selected or under study that
have not yet met the criteria to be in the reliability model. For instance, the PSC recently identified a
new  public  policy  transmission  planning  need  for  NYISO  to  solicit  proposed  solutions  and  that  is
intended to support the integration of 4.7 GW of wind resources in New York City.

Furthermore, in 2020, the PSC ordered the New York utilities to undertake planning assessments and
make investment proposals to facilitate the cost-effective development of renewable and emissions-
free  resources  while  maintaining  the  reliability  of  New  York’s  electric  grid.  The  Coordinated  Grid
Planning Process (CGPP) was approved by the PSC in August 2023. The process is designed to assess
the state’s electric grid using a 20-year planning horizon. The CGPP is intended to identify electric grid
expansions that can aid in unlocking renewable generation capacity and provide energy headroom for

the purpose of meeting New York’s clean energy goals while providing value to customers. Moreover,
the  CGPP  is  designed  to  identify  opportunities  for  expansion  of  the  bulk  transmission  system  to
advance the mandates of CLCPA. This provides another opportunity to inform the PSC’s consideration
of whether to establish a public policy transmission need for NYISO to solicit and evaluate proposed
solutions.

Reliability Issues
The 2024 RNA, targeting completion in the fourth quarter of 2024, identifies transmission security
violations  of  reliability  criteria  primarily  driven  by  a  combination  of  forecasted  increases  in  peak
demand, limited additional supply, and the assumed retirement of generation in  New York City in
response  to  state  law  and  regulations.  Accounting  for  these  factors,  the  planned  bulk  power
transmission system will not be able to securely and reliability serve the forecasted demand in New
York City. When accounting for forecasted economic growth and policy-driven increases in demand,
the New York City (Zone J) will be deficient starting in summer 2033 by as much as 17 MW for 1 hour
and  increasing  to  97  MW  for  3  hours  in  summer  2034  on  the  peak  day  during  expected  weather
conditions. The Reliability Need occurs within the transmission district owned by Consolidated Edison
Company of New York, Inc. (“Con Edison”). Con Edison is designated as the Responsible Transmission
Owner  in  the  NYISO’s  transmission  planning  process  and  required  to  submit  a  regulated  backstop
solution  to  address  the  need,  which  may  be  triggered  if  sufficient  market-based  solutions  do  not
materialize.

Prior to the 2024 RNA, the NYISO completed the 2023 Q2 STAR on July 14, 2023. This assessment
found a reliability need beginning in summer 2025 in New York City primarily driven by a combination
of forecasted increases in peak demand and the assumed unavailability of certain generation in New
York City affected by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Peaker Rule.
The reliability need is a deficiency in the transmission security margin. Specifically, the New York City
zone is deficient by as much as 446 MW for a duration of nine hours on the peak day during expected
weather conditions (95 degrees Fahrenheit) when accounting for forecasted economic growth and
policy-driven increases in demand. To ensure the continued reliability of electric service in New York
City, NYISO designated the generators on the Gowanus 2 & 3 and Narrows 1 & 2 barges as necessary
for  reliability  to  temporarily  remain  in  operation  after  the  Peaker  Rule  compliance  date  until
permanent solutions to the need are in place, for an initial period of up to two years (May 1, 2027).

The transition to a cleaner grid in New York is leading to an electric system that is increasingly dynamic,
decentralized, and reliant on weather-dependent renewable generation and may lead to increasing
reliability issues on the New York system. Reliability margins are shrinking. Generators needed for
ERSs are planning to retire. Delays in the construction of new supply and transmission, higher-than-
expected demand, and extreme weather could threaten reliability and resilience in the future. The

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment

system  is  projected  to  become  winter-peaking  in  the  next  decade  due  to  electrification  and
decarbonization policies. Large loads are being proposed to interconnect to the system. New York’s
current  reliance  on  neighboring  systems  is  expected  to  continue  through  the  next  10  years.  A
successful transition of the electric system requires replacing the reliability attributes of existing fossil-
fueled generation with clean resources with similar capabilities. Such resources must be significant in

capacity and have attributes such as the ability to come on-line quickly, stay on-line for as long as
needed, maintain the system’s balance and stability, and adapt to meet rapid, steep ramping needs.
New transmission is being built but more investment is necessary to support the delivery of offshore
wind energy to connect new resources located in upstate to downstate load centers where demand
is greatest.

Existing and Tier 1 Resources

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment

Highlights

•  While potential reserve margin shortfalls are forecast for 2027 and 2029, they are mainly driven by changes in the IESO’s resource adequacy assessment methodology since the 2023 LTRA. Last year, reserve
margin calculations included the continuation of existing resources (following contract expiry) for the entire outlook period. For this LTRA, reserve margins reflect the contribution of existing resources only
until the end of their contract or commitment period. This change to the methodology is more conservative and helps to better identify system needs in the IESO’s planning assessments to establish resource
acquisition targets and address anticipated needs.

•  The IESO has two capacity sharing agreements with Hydro-Québec providing firm summer capacity, which will help to address future shortfalls this decade.

•  The IESO has completed a broad set of actions to secure new capacity for this decade to ensure that Ontario’s power system needs are met during a period of nuclear retirements and refurbishments and
economy-wide demand growth. This includes securing long-term commitments amounting to 2,195 MW of new capacity to be on-line by 2028, with early operation incentives anticipated to bring a portion
on-line as early as 2027 to help alleviate the reserve margin gap.

•  The annual capacity auction, which helps to meet needs in the short term by securing capacity for up to one year at a time, has historically secured more capacity than targeted. Trends suggest that this

should continue, as the November 2024 auction (which will help to ensure reliability through summer 2025 and winter 2025–2026) also secured more capacity than targeted.

•  The IESO is taking steps that will address future shortfalls around the end of this decade and heading into the 2030s. The next round of medium- and long-term procurements was recently launched to ensure
that capacity and energy needs continue to be met. The second medium-term procurement aims to re-commit existing resources with contracts expiring over the 2026–2029 period, while the second long-
term procurement aims to secure capacity and energy from new resources (to be online as early as 2029), to meet needs emerging in the early 2030s.

•  The IESO is also responsible for implementing new provincial policy as outlined in the Ontario government’s July 2023 Powering Ontario’s Growth report, which includes developing new nuclear projects,
transmission expansions, and expanded conservation and demand management programs. The IESO will also incorporate changes stemming from the federal release of the final Clean Electricity Regulations,
anticipated toward the end of 2024.

NPCC-Ontario Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The  ARM  falls  below  the  RML  starting  in  2027.  While  expected  nuclear  retirements,  the  ongoing
nuclear refurbishment program, and demand growth are resulting in increased needs this decade, the
reserve margin shortfalls indicated in 2027 and 2029 are primarily driven by the change in the IESO’s
resource adequacy assessment methodology described above.

Mid-decade capacity needs that were identified in the 2022 Annual Acquisition Report have been met
through a series of competitive procurements. Since May 2023, the IESO has secured over 3,600 MW
of  new  capacity  from  battery  storage,  natural  gas,  and  biogas  facilities,  expected  to  come  on-line
between  2025  and  2028.  In  addition,  the  2023  capacity  auction  secured  1,867  MW  of  summer
capacity and 1,311 MW of winter capacity above targets of 1,400 and 850 MW, respectively. The IESO
continues  to  actively  procure  existing  and  new  resources  to  meet  longer-term  needs,  using  the
mechanisms in the Resource Adequacy Framework.

Ongoing  refurbishments  at  Bruce  Nuclear  Generating  Station  (NGS)  and  Darlington  NGS  will  see
between one and three reactors concurrently off-line through Summer 2033. Refurbishments remain
on or ahead of schedule and outages continue to be managed to limit impacts to the grid. Following
the  return  to  service  of  refurbished  units  at  Bruce,  each  unit  is  expected  to  be  uprated,  with  the
additional capacity anticipated to be available in the early 2030s.

The Ontario government has also announced a plan to deliver three additional small modular reactors
in  addition  to  the  300  MW  unit  already  underway  (anticipated  on-line  in  2029).  The  provincial
government’s  July  2023  Powering  Ontario’s  Growth  plan  directed  the  IESO  to  conduct  an  impact
assessment on potentially adding 4,800 MW of large-scale nuclear capacity to Bruce NGS. Approval
was granted from the federal nuclear regulator in October 2024 to extend operation of four units at
Pickering  NGS  (previously  scheduled  for  decommissioning  in  2025)  through  September  2026.  The
government is also supporting the refurbishment of the four units at Pickering, with refurbishment of
the first unit anticipated to be completed in 2031.

To address resource adequacy needs emerging mid-decade due to the combined effect of nuclear
retirements  and  refurbishments,  as  well  as  expiring  generation  contracts,  the  IESO  has  employed
competitive acquisition mechanisms from the Resource Adequacy Framework in part via the capacity
auction  referenced  above.  The  IESO’s  first  long-term  procurement  concluded  in  May  2024  and
secured long-term commitments from 10 battery storage facilities for 1,784 MW of new capacity and
three  natural  gas/biogas  facilities  for  411  MW  of  new  capacity.  Facilities  are  anticipated  to  be  in
service as early as May 2027.

The  IESO  calculates  the  reserve  margin  requirement  on  an  annual  basis  and  publishes  this  in  the
Annual Planning Outlook (APO). The requirement is calculated for each year for net demand at the
time of the annual demand peak to provide an LOLE that is at or below 0.1 days per year. The reserve
margin requirement in the 2024 LTRA is derived from the capacity requirement in the 2024 APO, plus
any material changes to demand and supply following APO publication.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
Energy adequacy assessments are conducted annually for the APO by using a deterministic approach
in  the  IESO’s  economic  dispatch  model.  In  addition,  the  IESO’s  capacity  adequacy  assessments
consider the system’s ability to serve load in all hours of the year (i.e., during peak hours as well as
non-peak load hours).

As demand requirements increase, nuclear refurbishments continue, and some units at the Pickering
NGS  retire  in  2024,  Ontario’s  energy  needs  are  expected  to  be  met  this  decade  by  the  resources
secured  through  the
IESO’s  recently  completed  procurements.  The  second  medium-term
procurement,  which  was  recently  launched,  aims  to  secure  capacity  and  energy  from  existing
resources reaching contract end; this is expected to help alleviate energy risks in the latter half of this
decade.  The  second  long-term  procurement  that  is  underway  aims  to  acquire  new  capacity  and
energy-producing resources and is anticipated to alleviate energy risks in the early 2030s.

Factors  that  could  increase  energy  adequacy  risks  include  aging  resources  and  the  potential  for
decreased  performance,  market  exit  of  resources  reaching  contract  end,  extreme  weather,  and
decarbonization policies and risks presented by new resources, including in-service delays or a high
risk  of  forced  outages  during  the  initial  period  of  operation.  Deliverability  challenges  for  new
resources and long lead times required to build new transmission may also increase energy adequacy
risks. Demand-side factors include  materialization  of data  centers, increased  industrial automobile
production and EV supply chain loads, and climate change impacts on weather-sensitive load.

Looking forward, with the federal government’s proposed Clean Electricity Regulations to decarbonize
Canada’s electric system by 2050, the IESO is assessing the role of natural gas generation as a flexible
resource in the interim as new sources of non-emitting supply are added to the system.

The IESO conducts probabilistic resource adequacy assessments annually in conjunction with NPCC to
identify regional capacity resource needs and to comply with NPCC and NERC reliability requirements.
Results from the 2024 ProbA are shown in the table on the next page. The low risk of unserved energy
is concentrated in the summer peak period, which typically occurs in late August.

Hourly demand and resource projections for a representative summer risk-day in 2026 are shown in
the figure below. Expected resource contributions are not sufficient to meet expected demand on the
risk day. The risk could be exacerbated by either a lower-than-expected resource contribution event
or a higher-than-expected demand event, with greater risk being due to a larger variability in resource
contribution. There is expected strain on the system from the hours beginning 12:00 p.m. through
8:00 p.m. If resource contributions are less than expected, strain on the system at expected demand
conditions could be seen for almost all hours of the day beginning at 7:00 a.m. Reliance on external
assistance may be necessary during peak conditions.

Hourly Probabilistic Assessment Results | Representative Summer Risk Day 2028

Demand
Forecasted  demand  for  this  2024  LTRA  outlook  period  (relative  to  the  2023  LTRA  outlook  period)
indicates 10% higher annual energy demand, 8% higher summer peak demand, and 9% higher winter
peak demand.

With an expanding agricultural and greenhouse sector, along with increasing electricity use for home
heating and transportation, summer and winter peaks are anticipated to converge over the forecast
period, leading Ontario to be dual-peaking by 2030. In the near term, the peak magnitude is expected
to increase slightly as the province exits the remnants of the post-pandemic inflationary cycle, and
new industrial projects supporting decarbonization begin commercial operation. Over this assessment
period, the IESO projects total internal demand growth to increase at a compound annual growth rate
of 2.34% for  summer and  2.75% for winter. Offsetting  the growth in demand are reductions from
conservation,  including  savings  from  EE  programs  and  codes  and  standards  regulations,  electricity
price responsiveness and increased output by embedded generation.

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
82

Ontario’s  Industrial  Conservation  Initiative  (ICI)  acts  as  a  critical  peak  pricing  program  leading  to
reductions  in  demand  at  peak  and  is  expected  to  reduce  around  1,500  MW  if  the  hour  of  annual
system  peak  demand  occurs  in  the  summer  or  around  1,000  MW  if  it  occurs  in  the  winter.  It  is
expected to scale based on increased industrial growth in future years, with reductions in 2034 of
2,000 MW for a summer peak demand hour and over 1,400 MW for a winter peak demand hour.

Demand-Side Management
DR capacity, from both dispatchable loads and hourly DR resources (e.g., residential or commercial
and industrial load), is procured through the IESO’s annual capacity auction. Starting with the 2023
capacity auction, the IESO implemented a capacity qualification process for all resource types eligible
to participate, which applies resource-specific calculation methodologies to determine the amount of
unforced capacity (UCAP) each resource is eligible to offer into the auction.

In June 2023, the IESO launched Peak Perks, a residential DR program where participants help reduce
demand by up to 150 MW through brief, time-limited thermostat adjustments during periods of peak
electricity demand in the summer months.

In July 2023, the IESO launched an interruptible rate pilot to provide large-load customers with an
interruptible rate in exchange for agreeing to temporarily reduce demand when directed by the IESO.
The pilot spans a three-year period and up to 15 events of up to four-hour duration can be called,
primarily in the day-ahead timeframe but also on shorter notice.

Forecast  savings  from  the  IESO’s  2021–2024  Conservation  and  Demand  Management  Framework
were included in the forecast and resulted in a decrease in demand. Savings from the 2021–2024 CDM
framework are expected to persist beyond the end of 2024. In February 2024, Ontario’s minister of
energy asked the IESO to examine options and analysis for a post-2024 EE framework and programs.

Distributed Energy Resources
The IESO estimates that contracted DERs contributed more than 3,400 MW of capacity and 5.3 TWh
of energy in 2023, more than half of which is solar PV, one-third wind, and modest contributions from
hydroelectric and biomass resources. While the IESO has little insight into uncontracted DERs, it has
observed energy contributions of approximately 2 TWh in 2023.

Generation
Recent generation procurements are provided in the PRM section.

The transmission-connected supply mix in Ontario has shifted over the past decade from having only
synchronous generation facilities to one with more IBRs including wind, solar, and storage. Previous

assessments performed by the IESO indicate that Ontario is expected to have sufficient inertia and
frequency response to ensure stable operation up to 2025.

Going forward, the addition of over 2,900 MW of new battery storage resources in the next few years
will increase the proportion of IBRs on the system. With the shift toward a higher proportion of IBRs,
further  areas  that  will  be  explored  include  the  sufficiency  of  the  resource  mix  to  provide  system
inertia,  primary  frequency  response,  operating  reserve,  ramping  capability,  reactive  support,  and
voltage  control.  If  needs  are  identified,  the  IESO’s  procurements  may  be  used  as  one  avenue  to
acquire resources that can provide the required services.

The IESO has also been taking a proactive approach to dealing with challenges posed by IBRs. This
includes working to optimize the location of IBR resources acquired through the IESO’s procurements
to minimize performance issues and initiating a review of the IESO’s Market Rules to align with the
latest  IEEE  2800  standard,  which  aims  to  establish  uniform  technical  minimum  requirements  for
interconnection, capability, and lifetime performance of IBRs.

Energy Storage
By  May  2028,  over  2,900  MW  of  new  battery  storage  resources  are  expected  to  come  on-line,
including the 250 MW/1,000 MWh Oneida battery storage facility (expected to be operational in June
2025), and 2,714 MW of battery storage resources secured through the IESO’s first set of long-term
procurements.  Of  this,  930  MW  is  expected  to  reach  commercial  operation  by  May  2026  and  the
remaining  1,784  MW  by  May  2028.  These  standalone  battery  storage  resources  (with  a  minimum
four-hour  duration)  are  expected  to  support  the  reliable  operation  of  Ontario’s  electric  system
through the ability to be dispatched by the IESO and ramp up and down quickly. The resources are
also  located  in  areas  of  Ontario  where  transmission  security  or  resource  adequacy  needs  were
identified.

Newly acquired energy storage facilities through the IESO’s first set of long-term procurements will
be required to be available during peak hours.

Capacity Transfers
Firm capacity imports and exports with neighboring jurisdictions are included in the IESO’s planning
studies. For non-firm imports, the IESO assumes a limited amount for the purposes of its reliability
assessments. Non-firm imports are assumed to be 250 MW for summer and 240 MW for winter, an
amount considered likely to flow throughout the year, including under tight supply conditions and
prices.

In November 2024, the IESO and Hydro-Québec finalized a new capacity sharing agreement for a swap
of a minimum of 600 MW of capacity per season. Under this agreement, the IESO will deliver capacity

to  Québec  during  the  winter  period  and  Hydro-Québec  will  deliver  capacity  to  Ontario  during  the
summer period. The agreement commences in the Winter 2024–2025 season and runs to October
2031, with an option for an extension for an additional three years. Other terms of the agreement are
expected to include the option for the IESO to increase the minimum amount provided to Québec
each year and to bank any amount of the 600 MW from Québec for use in a future summer period
over the term of the agreement.

The 2023 capacity auction secured 300 MW of system-backed imports from Québec for the Summer
2024 obligation period. As part of the 2016 capacity sharing agreement between Ontario and Québec,
the IESO may call on a total of 500 MW of firm imports from Hydro-Québec, which may be requested
all  in  one  summer  or  in  smaller  amounts  over  multiple  summers.  The  IESO’s  recent  assessments
indicate the intention to utilize the 500 MW of firm imports from June to September 2027 to help
meet resource adequacy needs. However, depending on the outcomes of the ongoing procurements
and changes to Ontario’s resource adequacy outlook, the IESO may choose to utilize this capacity in
another year.

Transmission
The existing transmission system in northeastern Ontario has insufficient capability to reliably supply

reinforcements in the region to address this need. Several of the recommended reinforcements are
in the early project development stage and one is undergoing a transmitter selection process.

The  IESO  recently  recommended  additional  transmission  reinforcements  in  southwest  Ontario  to
support  the  area’s  medium-term  needs,  including  a  double  circuit,  230  kV  line  from  Lambton
transmission  station  to  Chatham  substation,  expected  in-service  by  2028,  and  a  new  500  kV
transmission line connecting Longwood and Lakeshore transmission stations, to be in-service by 2030.

continues to connect in the area.

Reliability Issues
Nuclear  refurbishment  over  the  next  decade  is  a  major  resource  risk  that  requires  additional
attention. The IESO has regular meetings with nuclear operators to assess probable delays and take
appropriate mitigation actions.

For long-term planning purposes, the IESO carries an additional level of nuclear refurbishment reserve
to  account  for  the  risk  of  refurbishment  delays  and  increased  forced  outage  rates  pre-  and  post-
refurbishment. In addition, advanced outage approvals are provided solely when Ontario is adequate
under extreme weather.

NPCC-Québec Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The ARM is based on existing and anticipated generating capacity and firm capacity transfers. The
Québec area projects an  ARM above the RML over the first five winters of  the assessment period
(2024–2025  to  2028–2029).  The  ARM  is  under  the  RML  for  the  winters  2029–2030  to  2034–2035
mainly due to the demand growth.

The RML is derived from the NPCC 2023 Québec Balancing Authority Area Comprehensive Review of
Resource Adequacy, which was approved by NPCC’s Reliability Coordinating Committee on December
5, 2023. The demand uncertainty captured in the reserve ratio reflects both weather and economic
uncertainty.  The  methods  and  assumptions  can  be  found  in  the  Comprehensive  Review  report
available on the NPCC website.

The assumptions used for this assessment, including demand forecast and resources, are consistent
with  the  Hydro-Québec  2023  Supply  Plan  update,  which  was  filed  with  the  Régie  de  l’énergie  on
November 1, 2023.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments

The main energy risk for the Québec area is associated with a series of dry years, hence the energy
reliability criterion established by the Régie de l’énergie. This risk surpasses the energy risk associated
with the other renewable resources over the horizon of this study. The potential impact of climate
change on the water inflows could be an issue for energy reliability and is therefore the subject of
various ongoing internal studies.

Hydro-Québec  conducts  probabilistic  resource  adequacy  assessments  annually  in  conjunction  with
NPCC  to  identify  regional  capacity  resource  needs  and  comply  with  NPCC  and  NERC  reliability
requirements. Results from the 2024 ProbA are shown in the table below. The low risk of unserved
energy  is  concentrated  in  the  winter  peak  period,  which  typically  occurs  in  late  January  to  early
February.

Hourly demand and resource projections for a typical winter risk day in 2026 are shown in the figure
below. Although expected resource contribution is expected to be enough to meet expected demand,
there is risk that above-normal demand could exceed resources. Demand could be 10–15% higher
than expected, which could strain the system from the hours beginning 3:00 p.m. through 10:00 p.m.
Also, if resource contributions are less than expected, the peak hour beginning at 6:00 p.m. could lead
to a loss-of-load situation. Reliance on external assistance may be necessary in these events.

The requirements are obtained by adding transmission and distribution losses to the sales forecasts.
The monthly peak demand is then calculated by applying load factors to each end-use and/or sector
sale. The sum of these monthly end-use sector peak demands is the total monthly peak demand.

In addition to wind projects, unit replacement projects at existing hydroelectric facilities are being
studied. Up to 2,000 MW of capacity could be added by replacing generating units with most recent
models, as outlined in Hydro-Québec’s Action Plan 2035.

Demand-Side Management
The  Québec  area  has  various  types  of  DR  resources  specifically  designed  for  peak  shaving  during
winter operating periods. The first type of DR resource is the interruptible load program that is mainly
designed for  large industrial customers; it has an impact of 2,784 MW on winter 2024–2025 peak
demand. The area is also expanding its existing interruptible load program for commercial buildings,
which will grow from 611 MW in 2024–2025 to 889 MW by the  end of the period study.  Another
similar program for residential customers is in operation and should gradually rise from 166 MW for
Winter 2024–2025 to 621 MW for Winter 2028–2029.

New dynamic rate options for residential and small commercial or institutional customers will also
contribute to reducing peak load during winter periods by 371 MW for Winter 2024–2025 and 445
MW  for  Winter  2034–2035.  Moreover,  data  centers  specializing  in  blockchain  applications  are
required to reduce their demand during peak hours at Hydro-Québec’s request. Their contribution as
a  resource  is  expected  to  be  around  269  MW  over  the  study  period.  Finally,  another  DR  resource
consists  in  a  voltage  reduction  scheme  allowing  for  a  250  MW  peak  demand  reduction.  EE  and
conservation programs are integrated in the assessment area’s demand forecasts.

Distributed Energy Resources
Total  installed  BTM  capacity  (solar  PV)  is  expected  to  increase  to  862 MW  in  2035.  Solar  PV  is
accounted for in the load forecast. Nevertheless, since Québec is a winter-peaking area, DERs’ on-
peak contribution ranges from 2 MW for Winter 2024–2025 to 5 MW for the last winter period. No
potential  operational  impacts  of  DERs  are  expected  in  the  Québec  area  considering  their  low
contribution.

Generation
Four  wind  projects  with  a  total  installed  capacity  of  4,000  MW  are  expected  to  be  commissioned
during the assessment period. The first project, Apuiat (204 MW), is expected to be commissioned in
2024–2025. The second project (1,144 MW divided into 6 wind farms) is expected to be commissioned
in December 2026. The third project is Des Neiges (1,200 MW) and is divided into three phases (400
MW each). The first phase is expected to be operational in the winter of 2026–2027. The second and
third phases are expected to be in service for the 2027–2028 and 2028–2029 winters, respectively.
The  fourth  project  is  made  of  1,500  MW  divided  into  8  wind  farms,  which  are  expected  to  be
operational in the winters of 2027–2028, 2028–2029 and 2029–2030, depending on the location.

Energy Storage
No energy storage facilities are planned to be commissioned during the assessment period.

Capacity Transfers
The governments of Québec and Ontario have signed an MOU of an agreement that allows a seasonal
capacity  exchange  between  the  two  areas  for  the  next  seven  years  except  for  the  year  2027  (no
exchange is allowed). The technical details of the agreement will be completed by Fall 2024 and will
be  in  place  from  Winter  2024–2025  to  winter  2030–2031.  This  agreement  will  be  firm  and  allow
Québec to import 600 MW from November to April. In summer, Québec will export 600 MW of firm
capacity to Ontario from May to October.

From  the  international  border  crossing,  the  dc  transmission  line  will  be  extended  145  miles  to  a
substation in Lewiston, ME, where the power will be converted from dc to ac. The project in Québec
also includes the construction of an dc to dc converter at the Des Appalaches substation and triggers
the need of thermally upgrade two 735 kV lines in the south of the system. The project is expected to
be in service in December 2025.

Hertel-New York Interconnection (CHPE)
This project, expected to increase transfer capability between Québec and New York by 1,250 MW, is
under construction. It involves the construction of a ±400 kV dc underground transmission line about
60 kilometers (37 miles) long from the Hertel 735/315 kV substation just south of Montréal to the
Canada-United  States  border.  The  project  will  connect  to  the  Champlain  Hudson  Power  Express
project (CHPE) in New York state. From the international border crossing, the dc transmission line will
be extended 339 miles to a substation in Astoria, NY, where the power will be converted from dc to
ac.  The  project  in  Québec  also  includes  the  construction  of  an  ac  to  dc  converter  at  the  Hertel
substation. The project is expected to be in service in May 2026.

Highlights

•  The ARM remains above the RML until 2034 when it falls below the 17.6% RML level.

•  PJM implemented a number of changes to the 2023 load forecasting process to improve model accuracy, switching from an annual to monthly end-use model for PJM’s sector models to better determine
heating, cooling, and other non-weather-sensitive load and moving to an hourly model to better capture new technologies and peak shifting. Additionally, higher expectations for data center loads now
incorporate 15-year forecasts from impacted electric distribution companies (EDC).

•  PJM’s review of recent policies (e.g., state laws and federal environmental initiatives) indicates over 32 GWs of potential deactivations through 2034. The pace of retirements is being driven in large part by
these state laws and federal environmental initiatives that create a clear near-term, date-certain requirement for generation to comply or retire. Conversely, there are multiple mandates with renewable
portfolio standards (RPS) that account for the majority of over 150 GWs submitted projects.

PJM Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The ARM does not fall below the RML in PJM until 2034. PJM’s growing demand profile and a change
in resource mix that favors VERs, however, present a new level of risk.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
PJM is forecasting around 30% installed reserves (including expected committed demand resources),
which is well above the target installed reserve margin of 17.7% necessary to meet the 1-day-in-10-
years LOLE criterion. Due to the current low penetration of energy-limited and VERs in PJM relative
to PJM’s peak load, the hour with most loss of load risk remains the hour with highest forecasted
demand.  To  address  future  reliability  concerns  due  to  growing  VER  penetration  and  limitations
associated  with  the  performance  of  those  resources,  PJM’s  Effective  Load  Carrying  Capability
methodology calculates the reliability and energy contribution of limited and variable resources.

Some of PJM’s assumptions for determining the resource mix to use in the ProbA differ from those
used in developing the LTRA. Only a portion of the Tier 1 resource additions are used in the ProbA to
more accurately reflect historical rates of development. Additionally, more generator retirements are
used in the ProbA based on PJM’s generator forecasting. These assumptions are more consistent with
the  assumptions  included  in  official  studies  performed  by  PJM  to  support  its  capacity  market.  In
addition, the information in the ProbA for winter seasons refers to the Winter 2026–2027 and Winter
2028–2029 because PJM’s studies are based on “delivery years,” which start on June 1 of a year and
end on May 31 of the subsequent year.

Results of the 2024 ProbA are provided in the table below.

In  both  2026  and  2028,  most  EUE  and  LOLH  are  concentrated  in  the  winter  months  (especially
January), as shown in the following EUE heat maps. The risk occurs in days when temperatures are
very low, which results in high loads across the assessment area. If resource performance were to
occur at the levels expected during average winter days, the system should be able to serve these

high  loads.  However,  resource  performance  from  thermal  resources  on  very  cold  days,  especially
natural  gas  resources,  is  more  likely  to  be  poor.  This,  coupled  with  poor  performance  from  solar
resources,  results  in  very  low  total  electricity  supply  and  causes  loss-of-load  events  in  the  ProbA
analysis. The winter load-loss events tend to occur during morning and evening demand peaks and
coincide with poor thermal performance and poor solar performance.

The smaller shares of EUE and LOLH observed in the summer period for 2026 and 2028 are associated
with high temperatures and high loads across the assessment area that drive load-loss events in the
evening (hours ending 19 and 20) as grid-connected and BTM solar resource output declines. Low
performance  of  wind  resources  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  slightly  worse  performance  of  thermal
resources, also contribute to the load-loss events in the analysis.

Demand-Side Management

DR  resources  can  participate  in  all  PJM  markets—capacity,  energy,  and  ancillary  services.  DR  is
forecast to grow during summer peak season from 7,550 MW in 2025 to 8,400 MW in 2034.

Distributed Energy Resources
PJM expects 4,470 MW of solar DERs at the time of the peak in 2029 and 5,103 MW in 2034. The
effects of solar DERs are included in the load forecast for PJM. No effect of solar DERs is incorporated
in the winter load forecast since winter expected peak occurs after sundown.

Generation
Overall,  new  generation  is  coming  on-line  slower  than  anticipated.  Generator  retirements  are
outpacing the new generation replacing them. As a result, PJM could face future resource adequacy
challenges, impacting system reliability and PJM’s ability to serve load. PJM could be at risk of facing
resource  adequacy  challenges  if  these  trends  continue.  PJM  has  applied  an  11%  reduction  to  the
nameplate value of Tier 1 resources to reflect the historical rate of slower-than-anticipated addition
of new generation.

PJM reviews the progression of generation interconnection to understand overall developer trends
more  fully  and  their  impact  on  the  interconnection  process.  Of  new  and  expanded  generation
resources submitted in Queue A (1999) through December 31, 2023, 74,294 MW (or 15.8%) reached
commercial operation, 33,166 MW (or 7%) were withdrawn from the interconnection process after
Interconnection Service Agreement (ISA) execution, and 1,560 MW (or 0.3%) were withdrawn after
wholesale market participant agreement (WMPA) execution but before construction. Overall, 20.4%
of projects that requested uprates to existing capacity reached commercial operation.

2028 EUE Heat Map (Share of Annual EUE in %)

PJM implemented capacity reforms (approved by FERC) at the start of 2024, which include using the
loss-of-load model employed to perform the ProbA, as well as accreditation reforms based on the risk
patterns identified by said model, for the capacity auctions starting with delivery year 2025–2026.

Demand
PJM is experiencing large growth in data centers that are in turn driving higher demand forecasts.
Loudoun County, Virginia, in the PJM assessment area, is home to “Data Center Alley,” the largest
concentration of data centers in the world. Electrification in transportation, heating, and industrial
sectors is also spurring demand growth.

The PJM Interconnection produces an independent peak load forecast of total internal demand using
econometric regression models with daily load as the dependent variable and independent variables
including calendar effects, weather, economics, and end-use characteristics. PJM annually reviews its
load forecast methodology and implements changes when improvements are identified.
Summer peak load growth in PJM is projected to average 1.6% per year over the next 10-year period
and 1.6% over the next 15 years. The PJM summer peak is forecasted to be 176,822 MW in 2034, a

Stakeholders at the June 6, 2023, Interconnection Process Subcommittee meeting approved an issue
charge to examine how to enhance transfer of CIRs, which allow new generation to interconnect as a
capacity resource, from deactivating resources to new generation. The goal is to develop a solution
that  both improves the  efficiency of the process and clarifies  that it applies  to all energy-injecting
capacity resource types. The existing provisions in the PJM Tariff, and related defined terms included
in the Reliability Assurance Agreement (RAA), governing the CIR transfer process will be clarified to
reduce confusion as to which capacity resource types the transfer process applies.

PJM’s existing installed capacity reflects a fuel mix consisting of approximately 48% natural gas, 22%
coal, and 18% nuclear. Hydro, wind, solar, oil, and waste fuels constitute the remaining 12%. A diverse
generation portfolio reduces the system risk associated with fuel availability and reduces dispatch
price  volatility.  Totaling  nearly  125,000  MW  of  CIRs,  renewable  and  hybrid  fuels  are  changing  the
landscape of PJM’s interconnection process. Solar energy makes up 40% of the new service requests
in  PJM’s  generation  interconnection  queue.  State  policies  encouraging  renewable  generation  are
contributing to the rise in solar generation interconnection requests.

PJM’s review of recent policies indicates over 32 GWs of potential deactivations through 2034. The
pace of retirements is being driven in large part by state laws and federal environmental initiatives
that create a clear near-term, date-certain requirement for generators to comply or retire. See Energy
Transition in PJM: Resource Retirements, Replacements, and Risks (February 2023). Conversely, there
are multiple mandates with RPS that account for the majority of over 150 GWs in submitted projects.
Growing  levels  of  intermittent  and  limited  duration  resources,  such  as  wind,  solar,  and  battery
storage, do not replace conventional large-scale generation installations megawatt-for-megawatt but
rather require multiple megawatts to replace one megawatt of dispatchable generation due to their
limited availability in certain hours of the day and seasons of the year. Many megawatts from a range
of generation technologies, available at different times, are required to replace a megawatt of thermal
generating  capacity.  Looking  out  over  the  next  8  to  10  years  of  the  energy  resource  transition,
maintaining an adequate level of generation resources with operational and physical characteristics
that support reliability will be crucial for PJM’s ability to serve electrical demand reliably.

Energy Storage
Energy  storage  development  continues  in  PJM.  As  solar  generation  increases  in  PJM,  growth  of
storage  is  expected  to  follow  since  storage  devices  are  frequently  co-located  with  solar  projects.
Efficient  grid  operations  in  an  era  of  rapid  renewable  energy  resource  growth  will  require  greater
system  flexibility.  Energy  storage  can  offer  grid  operators  another  tool  to  maintain  stable  power
supply  under  varying  wind  and  solar  power  output  driven  by  weather  conditions  or  unit  outages.
Storage can also improve grid efficiency by increasing utilization of existing transmission lines. PJM
continues  to  work  with  members,  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  national  laboratories,  and  other

industry entities to advance the use of energy storage and, in particular, enable its participation in
PJM markets.

Today,  there  are  approximately  177  GWs  of  solar,  wind,  battery,  and  hybrid  in  the  PJM
interconnection  queue.  Hybrid  resources  make  up  approximately  26  GWs  and  standalone  storage
makes up approximately 28 GWs.

Some developers are pairing storage with variable, renewable generation, such as solar or wind, to
create opportunistic revenue streams. The pairing is either co-located (in which the storage facility
and the generator facility are sited on the same parcel of land but each has its own connection to the
grid) or hybrid (in which the storage facility and generator share a common connection to the grid).

Capacity Transfers
PJM  does  not  rely  on  significant  transfers  to  meet  resource  adequacy  requirements.  Maximum
transfer (total transmission interchange capability) into PJM would amount to less than 2% of PJM’s
internal generation capability. At no time within this assessment period does the ARM get anywhere
near 2%. PJM reliability would not be negatively affected if transfers were dropped to zero.

Transmission
PJM’s Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) continues to manage an unprecedented capacity
shift driven by federal and state public policy and broader fuel economics. This shift is characterized
by new wind and solar generating units driven by federal and state renewable incentives, generating
plant deactivations, and market impacts introduced by DR and EE programs. As of December 31, 2023,
renewable resources continue to represent a significant portion of PJM’s new services requests.

The PJM board approved 48 new baseline projects during 2023 at an estimated $6.6 billion to ensure
that  fundamental  system  reliability  criteria  across  the  grid  are  met.  The  board  also  approved  the
inclusion of 93 new network transmission projects at an estimated $180 million into the RTEP.

Reliability Issues
PJM’s 2023 Load Forecast Report addressed the impact of industry changes that are reshaping system
hourly loads. As a result, the level and timing of coincident peak and non-coincident peak demands
across  PJM  have  begun  to  shift.  Solar-power  penetration,  expected  impacts  of  EVs,  state
electrification  programs,  home  battery  storage,  and  a  significant  increase  in  data  center  loads  are
markedly increasing the complexity of PJM’s load forecasting process. Driven by discrete and localized
load  growth,  like  Data  Center  Alley  in  Loudoun  County,  Virginia,  in  2022,  PJM  and  stakeholders
conducted a  review of data center load growth and  identified growth rates of  over 300% in some
instances. As a result, the 2023 PJM Load Forecast Report incorporates adjustments to specific zones
for data center load growth.

Demand
Drivers of load growth are commercial expansion, electrification of heating and transportation, and
growth in residential load. Entities expect to continue to have increased economic growth that will
drive  both  population  and  employment  to  the  SERC-Central  assessment  area,  but  these  gains  in
employment are slightly offset by improvements in efficiency.

Distributed Energy Resources
SERC entities continue to monitor DER penetration levels, assess the impacts of DERs, and incorporate
these  impacts  in  system  studies.  Unlike  directly  modeled  transmission-connected  resources,  DERs
(e.g.,  rooftop  solar,  plug-in  EVs)  are  netted  against  load  in  the  Energy  Management  System  and
transmission  planning  models.  Some  entities  are  beginning  to  use  software  to  develop  DER

projections of rooftop solar. DER resource output is modeled at various levels to account  for load
scenarios. The overall amount of rooftop solar is small compared to the utility-scale projects.

Generation
Projected  coal  generation  retirements  total  4,399  MW  in  the  next  10  years.  Resource  additions
include 6,838 MW of natural gas, 75 MW of BESS, and 760 MW of solar generation over the next 10
years.

Generator retirements are carefully managed by entities in the SERC-Central assessment area. Entities
perform  studies  to  determine  the  impacts  of  confirmed  or  unconfirmed  retirements.  Entities
incorporate  these  studies  into  resource  plans  that  highlight  the  significance  of  future  generation
projects. Additionally, there are no significant retirement plans that will affect reliability.

Capacity Transfers
Entities participate in the SERC committees and study groups to perform power transfer studies of
the  system  within  the  SERC  geographic  area.  These  studies  include  evaluating  transfer  limitations
between all assessment areas within the Region for the existing or planned system configuration and
with normal (pre-contingency) operating procedures in effect, such that all facility loading is within
normal ratings and all voltages are within normal limits.

Transmission
The entities reported a total addition of 209 miles of new transmission lines until 2028. The entities
are also planning to upgrade 185 miles of transmission lines in the next 10 years to enhance system
reliability by supporting voltage and relieving challenging flows. Other projects include adding new
transformers,  upgrading  existing  transmission
lines,  storm  hardening,  and  other  system
reconfigurations/additions to support transmission system reliability. Entities do not anticipate any
transmission limitations or constraints with significant impacts on reliability.

SERC-East has changed from a summer-peaking assessment area to a dual-peaking assessment area,
with both a summer and winter peak. The addition of solar PV generation shaves off summer peak
demand,  and  a  trend  toward  electrification  of  heating  drives  up  winter  peak  demand.  The  ProbA
results for 2026 indicate some risk for SERC-East in the winter months of January and February. The
annual  EUE  is  143.35  MWh  but  for  a  very  short,  expected  duration  of  0.09  hours.  The  risk  occurs
during  winter  morning  hours  around  8:00  a.m.  due  to  a  combination  of  higher  loads  and  solar
resources not yet ramped up. For extreme cold weather events that might impact a wide geographical
footprint, there is also a limit on imports from neighboring areas.

For 2028, SERC-East continues to show winter risk with 207.26 MWh of EUE and 0.17 hours of LOLH.
The load is expected to grow by over 2%. The load-loss events in the analysis are for very few hours
and short duration, occur around 8:00 a.m., and are tied to extreme weather, higher forecasted load
levels, and lower resource performance. This can be seen in the following figures showing the risk
profile and resource performance for a likely event-day.

Demand
Population  growth  is  driving  demand  forecast  increases  in  SERC-East.  Entities  expect  faster-than-
average growth in the urban areas and overall increasing energy and demand in the 10-year forecast.
While the economic indicators used in the forecast have growth rates that vary during each year, the
economic outlook will contribute to increased energy and demand over the 10-year forecast. Some
entities project their EE adoption to impact roughly 1% of annual retail sales (after opt-outs) during
the 10-year forecast.

There are also many large commercial/industrial loads accounted for in the forecast that have been
announced or in discussions with the entities to locate in the service territory. If the large sites come
to fruition, it will drive significant increases in energy and demand during the later part of the 10-year
forecast.

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment

The projected EV adoptions are driving energy and demand increases during the later part of the 10-
year forecast window. EVs are currently the most significant contributor of all electrification sources
(e.g., heating, industrial) in the 10-year forecast.

Distributed Energy Resources
SERC entities continue to monitor DER penetration levels, assess the impacts of DERs, and incorporate
these  impacts  in  system  studies.  Unlike  directly  modeled  transmission-connected  resources,  DERs
(e.g.,  rooftop  solar,  plug-in  EVs)  are  netted  against  load  in  the  Energy  Management  System  and
transmission  planning  models.  Some  entities  are  beginning  to  use  software  to  develop  DER
projections of rooftop solar. DER resource output is modeled at various levels to account  for load
scenarios. The overall amount of rooftop solar is small compared to the utility-scale projects.

Capacity Transfers
Entities participate in the SERC committees and study groups to perform power transfer studies of
the  system  within  the  SERC  geographic  area.  These  studies  include  evaluating  transfer  limitations
between all assessment areas for the existing or planned system configuration and with normal (pre-
contingency) operating procedures in effect, such that all facility loading is within normal ratings and
all voltages are within normal limits.

Transmission
The entities reported a total addition of 286 miles of new transmission lines through 2028. The entities
are  also  planning  to  upgrade  515  miles  of  transmission  lines  through  2031  to  enhance  system
reliability by supporting voltage and relieving challenging flows. Other projects include adding new
transformers,  upgrading  existing  transmission
lines,  storm  hardening,  and  other  system
reconfigurations/additions to support transmission system reliability. Entities do not anticipate any
transmission limitations or constraints with significant impacts on reliability.

Planning Reserve Margins
The ARM is not expected to fall below the RML for any period of the assessment period.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
The 2024 ProbA results shown in the table below indicate negligible unserved energy and load loss.
Analysis of detailed ProbA outputs shows that that the negligible risk in year 2026 is associated with
hot late-summer or early fall conditions, high generator forced outages, and upper levels of economic
load forecast models. The risk occurs in evening hours around 7:00 p.m. when contribution from solar
generation is limited.

For study year 2028, the ProbA results shows very low risk with 16.28 MWh of EUE and 0.02 LOLH
hours. The driver of the risk is mainly extreme winter weather, similar to conditions from 1989, when
Florida  experienced  one  of  the  worst  winter  freezes  on  record.  With  higher  load  levels  and  lower
resources in 2028, the low risk shifts to late December, occurring in morning hours when contribution
from solar generation is limited, and is associated with winter freeze events that limit imports.

Demand
The individual entities within the FL-Peninsula Subregion develop their load forecasts and the Florida
Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC) then aggregates these forecasts to calculate a non-coincident
seasonal peak for the subregion. Each entity adjusts their forecasts annually to account for their actual
peak demands, updated economic outlooks, population growth, weather patterns, conservation and
energy efficiency efforts, and electric appliances usage patterns. Based on the data reported in the
2023 FRCC Regional Load and Resource Plan, the net energy for load (NEL) and summer peak demands
are forecasted to grow when compared to previous forecasts. The current average annual growth rate
for the NEL is 0.97% per year. Firm summer and winter peak demand growth are expected to increase
to 1.19% and 1.17%, respectively.

Demand-Side Management
Controllable  DR  from  interruptible  and  dispatchable  load  management  programs  within  the  FL-
Peninsula Subregion is treated as a load-modifier, and it is projected to be constant at approximately
6% of the summer and winter total peak demands for all years of the assessment period.
Distributed Energy Resources
SERC entities continue to monitor DER penetration levels, assess the impacts of DERs, and incorporate
these  impacts  in  system  studies.  Unlike  directly  modeled  transmission-connected  resources,  DERs
(e.g.,  rooftop  solar,  plug-in  EVs)  are  netted  against  load  in  the  Energy  Management  System  and
transmission  planning  models.  Some  entities  are  beginning  to  use  software  to  develop  DER
projections of rooftop solar. DER resource output is modeled at various levels to account  for load
scenarios. The overall amount of rooftop solar is small compared to the utility-scale projects.

Generation
Generator retirements are carefully managed by entities in the SERC-Florida Peninsula assessment
area. Entities perform studies to determine the impacts of confirmed or unconfirmed retirements.
Entities  incorporate  these  studies  into  resource  plans  that  highlight  the  significance  of  future
generation projects. Additionally, there are no significant retirement plans that will affect reliability.

Energy Storage
Electricity storage (ES) is still a growing capacity contributor in the assessment area. Over the next 10
years, a total of approximately 2,900 MW of ES generation is projected to be in service by 2032 and
is included in the utilities’ 10-year site plans (approximately 775 MW by 2029).
Individual entities in the assessment area that have installed or are projecting the installation of ES
are developing operating protocols on the use and dispatch of these facilities. ES units are studied as
part  of  the  normal  generation  interconnection  process  and  included  in  other  FRCC  studies  and
processes with members providing individual dispatch profiles and study levels in order to identify
potential operational impacts.

Capacity Transfers
Entities participate in the SERC committees and study groups to perform power transfer studies of
the  system  within  the  SERC  geographic  area.  These  studies  include  evaluating  transfer  limitations
between all assessment areas for the existing or planned system configuration and with normal (pre-
contingency) operating procedures in effect, such that all facility loading is within normal ratings and
all voltages are within normal limits.

The entities reported a total addition of 668 miles of new transmission lines through 2030. The entities
are  also  planning  to  upgrade  256  miles  of  transmission  lines  through  2031  to  enhance  system
reliability by supporting voltage and relieving challenging flows. Other projects include adding new

Demand
Data centers, cryptocurrency facilities, and large commercial and industrial load are driving demand
forecast growth in the assessment area. Metro areas are experiencing a higher growth rate compared
to rural areas.

Demand-Side Management
Entities within the SERC-Southeast assessment area use a variety of controllable and dispatchable DR
programs  to  reduce  peak  demand.  One  entity  manages  a  voluntary  DSM  water  heater  program
designed to allow system operators to control the appliances’ usage during peak demand periods.
Another  entity  monitors  and  dispatches  DR  programs  commensurate  with  contract  terms.  Annual
ELCC  simulations  are  performed  to  determine  the  capacity  value  for  each  unique  and  active  DR
program. An adjustment to that capacity value is then made based on predicted customer response
when the program is called or dispatched.

Distributed Energy Resources
SERC entities continue to monitor DER penetration levels, assess the impacts of DERs, and incorporate
these  impacts  in  system  studies.  Unlike  directly  modeled  transmission-connected  resources,  DERs

Transmission
The entities reported a total addition of 1,078 miles of new transmission lines in the next 10 years.
The entities are also planning to upgrade 694 miles of transmission lines during this time to enhance
system reliability by supporting voltage and relieving challenging flows. Other projects include adding

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment

Highlights

•  Generation resources, primarily solar PV, continue to be added to the grid in Texas in large quantities, increasing ARMs but also elevating concerns of energy risks that result from the variability of these
resources and the potential for delays in implementation. The summer ARM is above the RML (13.75%) for all 10 years of this assessment period (2025–2034). The ARM peaks at 34.7% by Summer 2026,
reflecting the expected addition of about 23,680 MW of Tier 1 capacity, most of which is solar PV.

•  The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) established a reliability standard and accompanying reliability assessment process in August 2024. The reliability standard is based on multiple probabilistic
reliability measures that capture the different dimensions of loss-of-load events: average event frequency (LOLE), maximum event duration, and maximum event magnitude. ERCOT will begin performing
reliability assessments required by the new standard in 2026.

•  ERCOT’s summer peak demand is forecast to increase by 4.6% per year from 2025 through 2029. In comparison, the five-year summer peak demand growth projection for the 2023 LTRA was 1.1%. This high
growth level is driven by a large amount of newly contracted loads planned for interconnection during this period. These contracted loads are mainly comprised of Permian Basin oil and gas production
facilities, data centers, crypto-mining operations, and industrial facilities.

Texas RE-ERCOT Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The summer ARM is above the RML (13.75%) for all 10 years of this assessment period (2025–2034).
The ARM peaks at 34.7% by Summer 2026, reflecting the expected addition of about 23,680 MW of
Tier 1 capacity, most of which is solar PV. However, the high reserve margin belies concerns over the
continuing trend toward less fully dispatchable resources and more IBRs like solar PV and wind. While
thermal  resource  availability  and  adequate  gas  supplies  are  still  concerns  during  extreme  winter
weather events, the fleet performed well during Winter Storm Heather in January 2024, indicating
that new weatherization standards, fully implemented in 2023, are effective.

Non-Peak Hour Risk and Energy Assurance
The PUCT established a reliability standard and accompanying reliability assessment process in August
2024. The reliability standard is based on multiple probabilistic reliability measures that capture the
different  dimensions  of  loss-of-load  events:  average  event  frequency  (LOLE),  maximum  event
duration, and maximum event magnitude. The latter two measures have an “exceedance tolerance,”
which  is  the  maximum  acceptable  percentage  frequency  of  loss-of  load  events  that  exceed  the
permissible thresholds based on a probabilistic simulation.

For non-winter months, ERCOT continues to experience the highest reserve scarcity risk during the
early  evening  hours—peaking  at  hour  ending  (HE)  9:00  p.m.—based  on  probabilistic  modeling  of
monthly peak load days. The elevated risk is due to the drop-off in solar generation and continued
higher loads during those hours. The summer peak load hour continues to be 5:00 p.m. For winter,
the  peak  load  hour  is  HE  8:00  a.m.  Risk  modeling  indicates  elevated  reserve  scarcity  risk  for  the
morning hours (HE 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.) as well as the early evening hours.

ERCOT is experiencing transmission limitations as a result of load growth and resource development
that affect energy delivery. On March 1, 2024, ERCOT introduced four new Interconnection reliability
operating limits (IROL) in the South Texas region. This consists of two South Texas import constraints
and  two  South  Texas  export  constraints,  which,  if  violated,  could  result  in  a  thermal  cascading
condition. This is the first thermal IROL that could lead to a cascading condition in the Texas RE-ERCOT
Region and has been attributed to the increase in generation capacity in South Texas and the rapid
load growth in central Texas. To manage the South Texas export constraint, generation in South Texas
must  be  curtailed  to  maintain  transmission  line  flows  below  100%  of  the  impacted  lines’  thermal
ratings. The risk of such curtailments, which is highest for the hours with the highest net peak loads
(early evening), is included in the monthly probabilistic reserve risk assessments. ERCOT has approved

two  San  Antonio  Reliability  projects  that  are  expected  to  be  completed  in  2027  and  should  help
alleviate some of risk drivers associated with these IROLs.

Increasing reliability risk in ERCOT is primarily driven by increasing large load demand anticipated from
data centers, Bitcoin operations, continued load growth in oil and gas-producing areas (such as the
Permian Basin), and growth in industrial facilities. Over 20 GW of newly contracted large loads, in
addition  to  other  organic  load  growth,  is  projected  to  be  added  to  ERCOT  by  2028.  ERCOT  also
anticipates 1,860 MW of fossil-fueled plant capacity to be retired by Summer 2028. New planned units
are primarily renewable and storage, which exhibit declining marginal reliability contributions. The
reliability  forecasts  provided  by  this  ProbA  assessment  for  2028  include  resource  capacity
contributions  from  expansion  planning  analysis  conducted  for  ERCOT’s  2024  Long-Term  System
Assessment.  While  there  is  uncertainty  around  the  deployment  of  these  resources,  the  large  load
demand  growth  is  also  uncertain  and  large  loads  are  subject  to  various  requirements  for  being
integrated into the grid.

All SERVM simulations for ERCOT and  surrounding  regions impose all relevant generator  temporal
constraints,  including  operating  limitations  on  conventional  units  as  well  as  state-of-charge  on
batteries, so this assessment accounts for energy adequacy. However, this assessment does assume
fuel for conventional units will be available when needed.37

The  unique  characteristics  of  winter  risk  vs.  summer  risk  can  be  seen  in  the  following  charts  of  a
representative  risk  day.  While  peak  winter  loads  can  persist  for  48  hours  or  longer,  peak  summer

periods generally only last for a few hours. This has significant implications for the duration and depth
of firm load-shed events in the winter as well as for the reliability contribution of energy limited and
non-dispatchable  resources.  The  most  extreme  winter  event  modeled  for  2026  was  16  hours  in
duration and 29 GW in depth. The illustration below indicates a winter EUE event with duration >12
hours while most summer events were 1–2 hours in duration.

From the hourly event data, ERCOT provided a multi-metric summary of the largest event showing
the highest magnitude and longest-duration, as shown in the following figure.

Demand
ERCOT’s long-term load forecast consists of the following individual components: (1) a base forecast
that  uses  an  econometric  model  with  estimation  data  comprising  15  historical  weather  years,
economic  drivers,  calendar  information,  and  historical  loads,  (2)  a  roof-top  PV  forecast,  (3)  an  EV
forecast, a large flexible load forecast (crypto-mining facilities), and new “large loads” with a signed
interconnection  contract  with  their  transmission  or  distribution  service  provider.  Forecasts  are
provided  for  eight  weather  zones  as  well  as  system  coincidental  and  non-coincidental  demands.
ERCOT’s summer peak demand is forecast to increase by 4.6% per year from 2025 through 2029. In

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
111

comparison, the five-year summer peak demand growth projection for the 2023 LTRA was 1.1%. This
high growth level is driven by a large amount of newly contracted loads planned for interconnection
during  this  period.  These  contracted  loads  are  mainly  comprised  of  Permian  Basin  oil  and  gas
production  facilities,  data  centers,  crypto-mining  operations,  and  industrial  facilities.  (A  negligible
amount of new contracted loads reported by transmission service providers occur past 2029). The
base peak load, which excludes these new contracted loads as well as load reductions due to rooftop
solar installations, grows at a more modest 1.4%.

A major load forecasting change from last year is a new Texas Legislature requirement to include non-
contracted loads in transmission planning studies. Non-contracted loads lack a signed Interconnection
or  facility  expansion  agreement.  ERCOT’s  previous  practice  had  been  to  exclude  these  more
speculative loads from the load forecast. The non-contracted loads total about 3.6 GW for summer
2025 and reach about 31.7 GW by 2029. The non-contracted loads are not included in the LTRA’s peak
load  forecast.  ERCOT  is  evaluating  how  these  non-contracted  forecasted  loads  will  be  handled  for
future resource adequacy and other planning activities.

Demand-Side Management
Most  of  the  demand-side  resources  available  to  ERCOT  are  dispatchable  in  the  form  of
noncontrollable  load  resources  providing  responsive  reserve  service  and  ERCOT’s  Emergency
Response Service. The ERCOT Emergency Response Service consists of 10- and 30-minute ramping
DRs and distributed generation that can first be deployed when physical responsive reserves drop to
3,000 MW and are not projected to be recovered above 3,000 MW within 30 minutes following the
deployment of non-spin reserves. Responsive reserve is provided by industrial loads and is procured
on an hourly basis in the day-ahead market. During 2023, load resources started to participate in two
other ancillary services, the Non-Spinning Reserve Service and ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service
(ECRS), which are used to help balance the system during periods when there may be net-load ramps
that cannot be met with conventional supply-side resources.

The remaining dispatchable DR available to ERCOT is from the transmission and distribution service
providers’ (TDSP) load management programs. These programs provide price incentives for voluntary
load  reductions  from  commercial,  industrial,  and  residential  loads  during  energy  emergency  alert
events.

Distributed Energy Resources
DERs that register with ERCOT to participate in wholesale energy and/or ancillary services markets
are  modeled  and  dispatched  in  ERCOT  transmission  planning  studies  similarly  to  transmission-
connected  resources  participating  in  those  markets.  For  DERs  not  participating  in  those  markets,
ERCOT relies on member TDSPs to provide information about individual DERs on their systems for
shorter-term reliability and economic impact studies, typically a one-to-six-year timeframe.

A  bill  was  approved  in  the  88th  Texas  Legislature  (HB  3390)  that  outlines  new  DER  reporting
responsibilities. The bill authorizes ERCOT to require TDSPs to provide unregistered DER information
that ERCOT deems necessary for grid reliability assessment. ERCOT is now developing annual data
collection and maintenance processes.

A multi-phase aggregated DER (ADER) pilot program was implemented in 2022. As of May 2024, there
were two ADERs with 13 MW of dispatchable capability actively participating in the pilot project with
another nine ADERs in various stages of registration/qualification.

Generation
Natural-gas-fired  generation  makes  up  approximately  45%  of  the  available  generation  inside  the
ERCOT  footprint.  Approximately  6%  of  the  natural-gas-fired  generation  demonstrates  firm  fuel
capabilities as part of ERCOT’s Firm Fuel Supply Service required by the PUCT.

ERCOT  has  established  formal  working  relationships  with  grid  generators’  fuel  suppliers  to  gather
operational and delivery information useful for its control room operators. ERCOT has focused the
efforts  on  two  fronts:  (1)  obtaining  real-time  (or  near  real-time)  information  on  the  health  of  the
natural gas systems that serve the generators and (2) maintaining communication with pipelines to
notify ERCOT of any planned or unplanned events that could impact deliveries to generators.

After the 2021 Odessa event, ERCOT intensified its efforts to find corrective measures to enhance the
ride-through  performance  of  IBRs  and  improve  overall  system  resilience.  The  study,  which
recommended installing synchronous condensers at six locations in West Texas, has been completed,
and the ERCOT board of directors endorsed the project in December 2023. The project is expected to
be in service in 2027.

ERCOT  has  proposed  new  grid  code  requirements  for  IBRs  to  improve  voltage  ride-through  (VRT)
performance to align with IEEE Standard 2800. The proposed grid code requirements are continuing
to  go  through  ERCOT’s  stakeholder  approval  process.  Until  new  rules  go  into  effect,  IBRs  will  be
expected to maximize VRT capability and address existing performance failures (such as by reducing
maximum output).

To provide an incentive to build new dispatchable resources, the PUCT adopted a new rule to establish
a  generation  loan  program,  one  of  four  incentive  programs  under  the  recently  established  Texas
Energy Fund (TEF). The other three programs within the TEF include completion bonus grants for new
dispatchable generation projects that consistently provide power generation over a 10-year period,
grants  for  companies  to  establish  or  secure  backup  power  resources,  and  grants  to  improve  the
resiliency and availability of electric utility service outside the ERCOT region. The TEF has $5 billion

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
112

available for all four programs. These loans and grants have thus far resulted in 72 applications seeking
funding under the TEF loan program. The PUCT staff-recommended portfolio represents 9,781 MW in
potential new generation if all recommended applicants were to execute a loan agreement at the
requested loan amounts.

Energy Storage
The current installed BESS capacity is 9,149 MW. These systems participate in ERCOT’s Energy and
Ancillary  Service  markets.  Most  have  durations  in  the  one-to-two-hour  range.  ERCOT  is  seeing  an
increase in longer-duration systems (three to four hours) to take advantage of energy-shifting and
capacity-firming opportunities arising from continued high renewable generation penetration. For the
first  half  of  2024,  energy  storage  provided  87%  of  ERCOT’s  regulation  up  and  91%  of  responsive
reserve service from primary frequency response (RRS-PFR). In June 2023, ERCOT implemented a new
ancillary service, the ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS), which, in part, is designed to address
the ramping needs of the system. This ancillary service product provides additional opportunities for
BESS ancillary service participation. To support larger BESS penetration levels, ERCOT submitted new
proposed rules for state-of-charge accounting in energy dispatch and reliability unit commitment that
are planned for implementation this year.

Based on the latest developer information for projects that are in the interconnection queue, ERCOT
expects about 10,500 MW of additional battery energy storage capacity to be operational by year-
end 2025. This capacity constitutes projects for which developers have posted financial security to
build  the  interconnection  facilities.  By  year-end  2029,  the  additional  cumulative  Tier  1  planned
capacity reaches about 20,000 MW.

ERCOT currently assigns a 0% on-peak contribution for battery energy storage. ERCOT has changed its
rule to adopt an ELCC methodology for battery storage of various durations. Extending the proposed
ELCC  methodology  for  BESS  to  current  and  forecasted  resources  in  ERCOT  would  improve  the
anticipated reserve margins in the future.

Capacity Transfers
ERCOT has coordination plans in place with neighboring grids. These plans cover dc tie emergency
operations, procedures for generators that can switch between grids, and temporary block load
transfers.

Transmission
In September, the PUCT approved ERCOT’s Permian Basin Reliability Plan. The plan consists of new
and upgraded local transmission projects as well as building new import paths to load centers in other
areas  of  the  Texas  RE-ERCOT  region,  including  options  for  extra  high  voltage  (EHV)  infrastructure

operating  at  345  kW  or  765  kV.  The  plan  supports  Permian  Basin  load  growth  that  is  currently
expected to reach 24 GW by 2030 and over 26 GW by 2038.

ERCOT’s 2023 Regional Transmission Plan (RTP) identified 173 reliability projects, with the majority
consisting  of  138  kV  and  345  kV  system  upgrades.  The  2023  RTP  also  included  an  economic
assessment of the ERCOT transmission system for years 2025 and 2028 using production cost savings
and generator revenue reduction tests.

The  substantial  increase  in  new  loads  from  a  year  ago  is  expected  to  present  challenges  for
transmission  planning.  The  forecasted  pace  of  the  load  growth  could  exceed  the  pace  at  which
transmission capacity can be built to support it. ERCOT is working on major changes to its transmission
planning process to address these challenges. For example, ERCOT is investigating a “generation hub”
concept  to  indicate  optimal  generation  location  to  address  regional  load  growth  and  optimize
transmission investments.

A new biennial report on grid resiliency—the Grid Reliability and Resiliency Assessment—evaluates
extreme  weather  scenarios  considering  different  levels  of  thermal  and  renewable  generation
availability and the potential outages caused by extreme weather conditions. The assessment also
includes proposed transmission projects that may mitigate regional resiliency risks. The first report
will be released by December 31, 2024.

New minimum deliverability criteria were included in ERCOT’s 2023 RTP to ensure the deliverability
of 100% of generation resource capacity and energy storage resources with a duration greater than
or  equal  to  two  hours.  For  storage  systems  with  a  duration  less  than  two  hours,  a  prorated
deliverability  was  ensured.  Corrective  action  plans  (CAP)  were  proposed  to  address  any  reliability
violations under the contingencies defined for the minimum deliverability criteria.

ERCOT has also started implementing the PUCT’s amended rules relating to certification criteria and
is in the process of integrating a new congestion cost savings test for economic projects evaluation.

Highlights

•  The ARM does not fall below the RML during the 2024–2034 timeframe.

•  The peak hour of demand for Alberta occurs in the winter. The peak hour for total internal demand is expected to grow from about 12.3 GW in 2024 to 13.1 GW in 2034, a 6.5% load growth over the forecast

horizon. The average year-to-year growth rate is 0.62%. There is a slight increase in the load forecast for this year’s LTRA versus last year’s.

•  Despite low resource adequacy risk, operational risk is still present. Ensuring sufficient frequency response capability has been identified as the region’s highest priority. Frequency response has been declining

in the region due to the increasing share of IBR resources and declining baseload resources. This under frequency load shedding risk is exacerbated in islanded or near-islanded situations.

•  Alberta’s two remaining coal-fired generators completed their conversion to natural gas this year.

WECC-AB Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The ARM does not fall below the RML during the 2024–2034 timeframe. From the 2032–2033 winter
onward, Alberta shows a shortfall of existing-certain and net firm transfers. This indicates that imports
may be necessary during this timeframe if new resources were to be significantly delayed.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
WECC performs a probabilistic analysis to evaluate the probability distribution curves of demand and
resource availability  together. The area where  those curves overlap represents the possibility that
there  will  not  be  enough  resources  available  to  serve  the  demand,  or  the  “demand  at  risk.”  The
greater the overlap area, the greater the likelihood that this will be the case. For this analysis, WECC
sets the risk tolerance threshold to the one-day-in-ten-year (ODITY) level, meaning that 99.98% of the
demand for each hour is covered by available resources (i.e., the area of overlap is equal to no more
than .02% of the total area of the demand curve for any given hour). The overlap—the demand at
risk—increases when one or both curves move due to increases to expected demand or decreases to
expected resource availability, or a combination of these (the curves maintain their original shape but
move closer together, increasing the overlap). The overlap is also increased through variability. When
rare events occur more regularly than predicted, the probability curve changes shape.

Results of the 2024 ProbA shown in the table below indicate negligible unserved energy and load-loss
risk.

The resource adequacy work performed at WECC uses the Multi-Area Variable Resource Integration
Convolution (MAVRIC) model. The MAVRIC model is a convolution-based probabilistic model and is
WECC’s chosen method for developing probability metrics used for assessing demand and variable
resource  availability  in  every  hour.  In  the  resource  adequacy  environment,  the  reports  produced

38 See WECC Reliability Assessments.

support NERC’s seasonal assessments, LTRA, and Probabilistic Assessment. WECC also produces an
annual reliability assessment called the Western Assessment of Resource Adequacy (WARA).38

The  availability  and  demand  distributions  in  the  ProbA  simulations  do  not  overlap,  indicating  an
extremely low probability of Alberta not being resource adequate over the next four years. For 2026
and 2028, the peak hour occurs in December at HE 18:00. Alberta does not show LOLH nor EUE in the
LTRA forecast horizon. The gap between the demand distribution and the supply distribution shown
in  the  figure  below  emphasizes  that  there  is  minimal  resource  adequacy  risk  in  Alberta.  The  ARM
appears to further validate this, as it is far above the RML for 2026 and 2028.

Demand
Peak demand for Alberta occurs in the winter. The peak hour for total internal demand is expected to
grow from about 12.3 GW in 2024 to 13.1 GW in 2034, a 6.5% load growth over the forecast horizon.
The average year-to-year growth rate is 0.62%. There is a slight increase in the load forecast for this
year’s LTRA versus last year’s. Near-term load growth is driven by industrial loads, such as oil sands
production, pulp and paper mills, and gas and oil processing. Long-term demand growth is driven by
electrification of transportation and buildings as well as potential growth in emerging industries, such
as hydrogen production.

Distributed Energy Resources
BTM DERs are difficult to measure due to data gathering barriers. AESO released its updated 2022
Plan for DER Roadmap Integration Activities.

Capacity Transfers
In WECC’s analysis, Alberta is not showing significant changes to capacity transfers. There is a slight
increase in exports between 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and in the later years of the assessment period.

Generation
Over  6  GW  of  nameplate  capacity  are  being  added  in  Alberta  through  the  end  of  2028.  There  is
significantly more solar, wind, and energy storage in this year’s planned capacity additions than in the
last LTRA. Additionally, several states and  provinces in the region as well as  cities and utilities are
implementing  renewable  or  carbon-free  electricity  targets.  Retirements  tend  to  be  concentrated
across three resource types: coal, nuclear, and natural gas. Coal and natural gas units are being retired
due to age and emissions. Alberta’s two remaining coal units have been converted to natural gas this
year.

Energy Storage
Energy storage is being relied on to help mitigate ramping risk from afternoon net demand due to
increasing penetrations of solar. Many additions are being co-located into hybrid PV + storage, but
there  is  also  increased  standalone  battery  storage.  Learning  curves  for  potential  operational
challenges to mitigate energy storage risks include further real-world testing under extreme weather
conditions, especially extended high temperatures such as during heat waves, and exploring solutions
to mitigate the risks of fire.

Reliability Issues
WECC notes that supply chain issues impacting transformers, circuit breakers, transmission cables,
switchgears, and insulators continue to be a risk to generation and transmission development and are
an ongoing reliability concern.

Highlights

•  The ARM does not fall below the RML during the 2024–2034 timeframe.

•  BC shows a shortfall of existing-certain and net firm transfers for the 2027–2028 winter and the 2028–2029 winter. Shortfalls are also projected from the winter of 2033–2034 onward. This indicates that

imports may be necessary during these periods if new resources were to be significantly delayed.

•  The peak hour of demand for BC occurs in the winter. BC shows the lowest demand growth rate in the west. The peak demand is expected to grow from about 12.0 GW in 2024 to 12.3 GW in 2034, slightly

less than in the previous LTRA forecast. This is an average annual growth rate of 0.28%, and a 2.8% load growth over the forecast horizon.

•  BC is showing hours of demand at risk that are not fully mitigated by the addition of Tier 3 resources. Supply chain performance will play a significant role in BC’s ability to reliably meet energy needs. Seasonal

and daily fluctuations of hydro resource availability is also a risk. LOLH and EUE correlate with periods when river flows are at their lowest.

Planning Reserve Margins
The  ARM  does  not  fall  below  the  RML  during  the  2024–2034  timeframe.  BC  shows  a  shortfall  of
existing-certain and net firm transfers for the 2027–2028 winter and the 2028–2029 winter. Shortfalls
are also projected from winter of 2033–2034 onward.  This indicates that imports may be necessary
during these periods if new resources were to be significantly delayed.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
WECC performs a probabilistic analysis to evaluate the probability distribution curves of demand and
resource availability  together. The area where  those curves overlap represents the possibility that
there  will  not  be  enough  resources  available  to  serve  the  demand,  or  the  “demand  at  risk.”  The
greater the overlap area, the greater the likelihood that this will be the case. For this analysis, WECC
sets the risk tolerance threshold to the ODITY level, meaning that 99.98% of the demand for each
hour is covered by available resources (i.e., the area of overlap is equal to no more than .02% of the
total area of the demand curve for any given hour). The overlap—the demand at risk—increases when
one or both curves move due to increases to expected demand or decreases to expected resource
availability,  or  a  combination  of  these  (the  curves  maintain  their  original  shape  but  move  closer
together, increasing the overlap). The overlap is also increased through variability. When rare events
occur more regularly than predicted, the probability curve changes shape.

Results of the 2024 ProbA shown in the table below indicate negligible unserved energy and load-loss
risk in 2026. In 2028, however, WECC’s analysis identified over five hours where resources, including
imports from neighbors, fall below margins for system reliability.

The resource adequacy work performed at WECC uses the MAVRIC model. The MAVRIC model is a
convolution  based  probabilistic  model  and  is  WECC’s  chosen  method  for  developing  probability
metrics used for assessing demand and variable resource availability in every hour. In the resource

adequacy  environment,  the  reports  produced  support  NERC’s  seasonal  assessments,  LTRA,  and
Probabilistic Assessment, as well as WECC’s WARA.

For both 2026 and 2028, the peak hour occurs in December at HE 19:00. LOLH and EUE are not forecast
in 2026 but do appear in 2028. No LOLH or EUE occurs at the peak hour. 88% of the EUE in 2028 occurs
overnight between the hours of 23:00 and 4:00.

In 2026, the peak summer hour is HE 17:00 in September, and in 2028 the peak hour is HE 17:00 in
August. There is no LOLH projected for 2026 or during peak hours. LOLH occurs in 2028 between the
hours of 17:00 and 20:00.

Icicle Plot with Hourly Surplus and Deficits for British Columbia in 2028
WECC’s  interconnection-wide  analysis  simulates  the  probabilistic  performance  of  resource  types
using  historic  hourly  output  data  to  identify  future  risk  periods.  Operators  of  systems  with  large
hydroelectric storage facilities make adjustments to generation based on the level of demand and
shape  the  water  use  within  the  day,  week,  month,  or  between  years.  These  actions  help  posture
hydroelectric generation for expected conditions and can reduce energy shortfall risks.

Demand
BC’s average annual load growth in its forecast has fallen to a rate below Alberta’s. The peak hour
total internal demand for BC occurs in the winter. The peak demand is expected to grow from about
12.0 GW in 2024 to 12.3 GW in 2034, slightly less than in the last forecast. This is an average annual
growth rate of 0.28% and a 2.8% load growth over the forecast horizon. BC’s load growth is lower due
to updated  monthly profiles that reflect current trends and aggressive DSM  which it includes as a

demand reduction in the demand forecasts provided to WECC. Load growth in BC is primarily driven
by  EV  and  gas  sector  load growth  and  is  partially  offset  by  a  decline  in  demand  from  the  forestry
sector.

Distributed Energy Resources
BTM DERs are difficult to measure due to data-gathering barriers. BC Hydro has net metering. Net
metering  for  residential  and  commercial  customer  projects  are  up  to  100  kW.  The  net  metering
program has no annual energy volume target.

Generation
Across WECC, several states and provinces as well as cities and utilities are implementing renewable
or carbon-free electricity targets. Retirements tend to be concentrated across three resource types:
coal, nuclear, and natural gas. Coal and natural gas units are being retired due to age and emissions.

In BC, hydro and wind resources are being added to the system. The BC Hydro Authority (BCHA) is
taking steps to mitigate risks associated with climate change by improving coastal watershed inflow
forecasting to an hourly level and increasing investment in capital projects to increase the resiliency
of its hydro-dominant portfolio. Drought conditions in BC have led to water conservation measures,
such as encouraging generation at facilities located in less drought-impacted areas, revising discharge
plans at storage capable sites, and importing power when available to reduce water consumption.

Capacity Transfers
WECC’s probabilistic analysis indicates that BC’s need for imports is increasing during the assessment
period.

Transmission
Three transmission projects with voltage design of 500 kV and higher are planned in the BC region.

Reliability Issues
WECC notes that supply chain issues impacting transformers, circuit breakers, transmission cables,
switchgears, and insulators continue to be a risk to generation and transmission development and are
an ongoing reliability concern.

Highlights

•  The ARM falls below the RML in Summer 2034, but the RML is covered by the PRM, which includes Tier 2 resource additions.

•  Starting in Summer 2029 onward, CA/MX shows a shortfall of existing-certain and net firm transfers. However, with planned generation resource additions the shortfalls are eliminated. Imports may be
necessary if the new resources were to be significantly delayed. LOLH and EUE are mitigated over the assessment horizon with the addition of Tier 2 resources and primarily correspond with the evening
down ramp of solar and lingering demand after peak.

•  The peak hour of demand for CA/MX occurs in the summer. Total internal demand at peak hour is expected to grow from about 56.4 GW in 2024 to 69.1 GW in 2034, a 22.5% load growth over the forecast

horizon. The average annual growth rate is 2.07%.

•  Diablo Canyon, a 2.2 GW nuclear site, will no longer be retired by 2025 and is now slated to be retired in 2030.

WECC-CA/MX Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The ARM falls below the RML in the summer of 2034. With the addition of Tier 2 resources, reserve
margins remain above RML. Starting in Summer 2029 onward, CA/MX shows a shortfall of existing-
certain and net firm transfers, meaning that imports may be necessary if new resources were to be
significantly delayed.

The  California  Independent  System  Operator  (CAISO)  is  responsible  for  much  of  the  BPS  that  is  in
CA/MX. CAISO manages the transmission system, oversees transmission planning, and operates the
wholesale electricity market for its territory. Other entities in CA/MX include the Balancing Authority
of Northern California (BANC), the Imperial Irrigation District (IID), and Mexico’s National Center for
Energy Control (CENACE), which operates the connected Baja California system.

CAISO Only: The ARM falling below the RML in Summer 2034 and the shortfall of existing-certain and
net firm transfers in Summer 2029 is consistent when looking at CA/MX or solely at CAISO. The RML
of CAISO averages 0.7% higher than the CA/MX region RML over the LTRA horizon. This is due to the
exclusion of natural gas and coal resource energy contributions from CA/MX entities outside of CAISO.
Decreasing baseload generators results in increased variability, which in turn requires a greater RML
to maintain the ODITY threshold. However, the gap between the anticipated, prospective, and existing
reserve margins and the RML for CAISO are greater than the broader CA/MX region. The proportion
of  energy  availability  to  anticipated  net  internal  demand  is  larger  for  CAISO,  accounting  for  this
increase.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
The resource adequacy work performed at WECC uses the MAVRIC model. The MAVRIC model is a
convolution-based  probabilistic  model  and  is  WECC’s  chosen  method  for  developing  probability
metrics used for assessing demand and variable resource availability in every hour. In the resource
adequacy  environment,  the  reports  produced  support  NERC’s  seasonal  assessments,  LTRA,  and
Probabilistic Assessment, as well as WECC’s WARA.

WECC performs a probabilistic analysis to evaluate the probability distribution curves of demand and
resource availability  together. The area where  those curves overlap represents the possibility that
there  will  not  be  enough  resources  available  to  serve  the  demand,  or  the  “demand  at  risk.”  The
greater the overlap area, the greater the likelihood that this will be the case. For this analysis, WECC
sets the risk tolerance threshold to the ODITY level, meaning that 99.98% of the demand for each
hour is covered by available resources (i.e., the area of overlap is equal to no more than .02% of the
total area of the demand curve for any given hour). The overlap—the demand at risk—increases when

one or both curves move due to increases to expected demand or decreases to expected resource
availability,  or  a  combination  of  these  (the  curves  maintain  their  original  shape  but  move  closer
together, increasing the overlap). The overlap is also increased through variability. When rare events
occur more regularly than predicted, the probability curve changes shape.

Results of the 2024 ProbA shown in the table below indicate negligible unserved energy and load-loss
risk in 2026. After 2026, however, WECC’s analysis identified periods of unserved energy and load loss
in CA/MX during June through October. Of note, this risk is limited to the Mexico portion of CA/MX
(i.e., ProbA results for the CAISO do not indicate LOLH or EUE) until 2029, when the risk extends across
the entire assessment area.

Though the hour and month of peak demand are the same for both CAISO and the broader CA/MX
region, CAISO shows the greatest amount of EUE and LOLH in September, whereas CA/MX shows the
greatest  amount  of  EUE  and  LOLH  in  August.  This  coincides  with  the  seasonal  reduction  of  solar
irradiance in the fall and CAISO having a proportionally larger share of solar resources than the CA/MX
region. Excluding regions external to CAISO results in a 96% reduction in LOLH events and EUE over
the LTRA horizon.

The hour of peak demand in summer occurs at 5:00 p.m. The hours of highest risk, however, occur
during periods after the peak demand hour as solar PV resource output diminishes. There is no LOLH
projected for 2026; however in 2028, the ProbA reveals some LOLH between the hours of 5:00 and
8:00 p.m.

Demand
The  peak  demand  for  CA/MX  occurs  in  the  summer.  The  peak  hour  for  total  internal  demand  is
expected to grow from about 56.4 GW in 2024 to 69.1 GW in 2034, a 22.5% load growth over the
forecast horizon. The average annual growth rate is 2.07%. Transportation and building electrification
are the primary drivers of demand growth.

CAISO Only: The demand forecast for CAISO grows at a slightly higher rate than the broader CA/MX
region, with a load growth of 25.2% over the LTRA forecast horizon, and an average annual rate of
2.1%.

Demand-Side Management
A  portion  of  the  near-term  decline  in  controllable  and  dispatchable  DR  for  Summer  2024  is  partly
driven  by  regulatory  changes  in  the  CA/MX  region.  This  includes  making  resource  adequacy  DR
crediting adjustments based on historical performance and increasing DR availability requirements.
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) determined resource adequacy values of utility DR
were overestimated during high load days. In response, the CPUC removed transmission gross-ups
and some credits from utility DR resource adequacy values starting in 2024. The CPUC also directed
that DR resource adequacy capacity must be available during all days the ISO calls a flex alert or issues
a  grid  warning  or  on  which  the  governor’s  office  has  issued  an  emergency  notice,  representing  a
significant increase in required availability. In addition, the CPUC now requires all DR capacity to be
available a minimum of three days per week for at least four hours per day.

For CAISO, energy efficiency and conservation drops significantly when excluding non-CAISO entities
from the CA/MX region. The entities outside of CAISO account for an average of 70% of the energy
efficiency and conservation DSM for the CA/MX region for the LTRA timeframe.

Distributed Energy Resources
BTM DERs are difficult to measure due to data-gathering barriers. CAISO allows seven DER aggregators
as  market  participants  for  energy  and  ancillary  services.  Additionally,  PG&E’s  Partnership  Pilot
includes new or existing solar, storage, energy efficiency and demand response used via third party
DER providers, vendors, or aggregators.

Generation
There is significantly more solar, wind, and energy storage in planned capacity additions than in the
last  LTRA.  Additionally,  several  states  in  the  region  as  well  as  cities  and  utilities  are  implementing
renewable  or  carbon-free  electricity  targets.  Retirements  tend  to  be  concentrated  across  three
resource types: coal, nuclear, and natural gas. Coal and natural gas units are being retired due to age
and emissions.

Energy Storage
Energy storage is being relied on to help mitigate ramping risk from afternoon net demand caused by
increasing penetrations of solar. Many additions are being co-located into hybrid PV + storage but
there  is  also  increased  standalone  battery  storage.  Learning  curves  for  potential  operational
challenges to mitigate energy storage risks include further real-world testing under extreme weather
conditions, especially extended high temperatures such as during heat waves, and exploring solutions
to mitigate the risks of fire.

Capacity Transfers
CA/MX is showing increasing amounts of exports to the northwest, especially during winter months.

Transmission
Seventeen transmission projects with 500 kV and higher are planned.

Reliability Issues
WECC notes that supply chain issues impacting transformers, circuit breakers, transmission cables,
switchgears, and insulators continue to be a risk to generation and transmission development and are
an ongoing reliability concern.

Highlights

•  The ARM falls below the RML starting in Summer 2031. With the addition of Tier 2 capacity, the PRM stays above the RML for all years in the LTRA time horizon.

•  Starting in Summer 2029 onward, the Northwest shows a shortfall of existing-certain and net firm transfers, meaning that imports may be necessary if new resources were to be significantly delayed. Five
GW of baseload resource retirements are anticipated between 2024 and 2028. The energy needs are to be replaced by solar and wind, supported by BESS. Supply chain issues preventing the construction of
BESS resources are a concern as they assist in meeting demand during shoulder periods where solar availability is dropping but loads remain high. LOLH and EUE are mitigated over the assessment horizon
with the addition of Tier 3 resources.

•

 The Northwest is dual peaking, so the peak hour can occur in either the summer or the winter. Probabilistic modeling efforts show a peak in the summer for this LTRA. The summer peak for the total internal
demand is expected to grow from about 66.4 GW in 2024 to 78.8 GW in 2034, which is lower than in the previous LTRA. This represents a nearly 18.7% load growth over the forecast horizon, with an average
growth rate of 1.73%.

WECC-NW Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The ARM falls below the RML starting in Summer 2031. With the addition of Tier 2 capacity, the PRM
stays above the Reference Margin for all years in the LTRA time horizon. Starting in Summer 2029
onward,  the  Northwest  shows  a  shortfall  of  existing-certain  and  net  firm  transfers,  meaning  that
imports may be necessary if new resources were to be significantly delayed.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
WECC performs a probabilistic analysis to evaluate the probability distribution curves of demand and
resource availability  together. The area where  those curves overlap represents the possibility that
there  will  not  be  enough  resources  available  to  serve  the  demand,  or  the  “demand  at  risk.”  The
greater the overlap area, the greater the likelihood that this will be the case. For this analysis, WECC
sets the risk tolerance threshold to the ODITY level, meaning that 99.98% of the demand for each
hour is covered by available resources (i.e., the area of overlap is equal to no more than .02% of the
total area of the demand curve for any given hour). The overlap—the demand at risk—increases when
one or both curves move due to increases to expected demand or decreases to expected resource
availability,  or  a  combination  of  these  (the  curves  maintain  their  original  shape  but  move  closer
together, increasing the overlap). The overlap is also increased through variability. When rare events
occur more regularly than predicted, the probability curve changes shape.

Results of the 2024 ProbA shown in the table below indicate negligible unserved energy and load-loss
risk.

The resource adequacy work performed at WECC uses the MAVRIC model. The MAVRIC model is a
convolution  based  probabilistic  model  and  is  WECC’s  chosen  method  for  developing  probability
metrics used for assessing demand and variable resource availability in every hour. In the resource
adequacy  environment,  the  reports  produced  support  NERC’s  seasonal  assessments,  LTRA,  and
Probabilistic Assessment, as well as WECC’s WARA.

Imports to the Northwest from the CA/MX region grow throughout the LTRA forecast horizon. A calm,
cloudy, extreme heat event occurring in the Northwest and CA/MX regions simultaneously poses a
risk to the Northwest by limiting surplus energy in CA/MX to send northward.

Energy variability is greater in the Northwest than other WECC regions due to the large share of wind
and  hydro  in  the  portfolio.  More  variability  in  energy  output  requires  a  greater  reserve  margin  to
maintain resource adequacy.

For 2026 and 2028, the peak hour occurs in August at HE 17:00. LOLH and EUE are not forecast in
2026 and only occur for a single hour in 2028. The LOLH occurred in August at HE 19:00, slightly after
peak. The LOLH corresponds with the declining solar availability in the evening while demand remains
high.

Demand
The  Northwest  is  dual  peaking,  so  the  peak  hour  can  occur  in  either  the  summer  or  the  winter.
Probabilistic modeling efforts show a peak in the summer for this LTRA. The summer peak for the total
internal demand is expected to grow from about 66.4 GW in 2024 to 78.8 GW in 2034, which is lower
than in the previous plan. This represents a nearly 18.7% load growth over the forecast horizon, with
an  average  growth  rate  of  1.73%.  There  are  significant  differences  between  balancing  areas,  with
some showing large load growth impacts while others showing a slight decrease in demand. Entities
reporting large load growth cite new data centers as a primary driver.

Demand-Side Management
In the Northwest, Idaho Power implements a substantial dispatchable DR program focused on the
agricultural sector with its Irrigation Peak Rewards Programs. This allows Idaho Power to remotely
turn off specific irrigation pumps a minimum of four times during the summer. Participation varies
year to year based on factors such as the availability of water and program parameters. In 2022, the
utility lengthened the season and included additional evening hours, which drove some reduction in
participation that carried over to the Summer 2024 availability.

PacifiCorp states in its most recent Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) that it hopes to reach 1,123 MW of
demand response by 2042 in its preferred portfolio plan, which is a 21% increase by 2042 from its
previous  plan.  PacifiCorp’s  dispatchable  DR  programs  include  residential,  small  commercial  air-
conditioner load control, irrigation load management, and 203 MW of interruptible contracts.

The  Public  Service  Company  of  Colorado  (PSCo)  also  offers  a  wide  array  of  DR  programs,  such  as
Saver’s Switch, which is a program where the air-conditioning unit of a customer may be controlled

remotely and cycled during extreme heat events. Peak Day Partners allows for the direct load control
and reduction of customers 0.5 MW or greater in size when system peaking conditions are met. The
Interruptible Service Credit Option (ISOC) is a program where customers agree to reduce consumption
in return for a rate discount with non-compliance being met with a fee.

Distributed Energy Resources
BTM DERs are difficult to measure due to data-gathering barriers. One example is Idaho Power’s filing
of annual DER Resources Status Reports by customer class and resource type, such as in 2023.

Generation
Five GW of baseload resource retirements are anticipated between 2024 and 2028. The energy needs
are to be replaced by solar, wind, and BESS, further increasing variability in the portfolio. Given the
retiring of baseload resources, supply chain issues preventing the construction of BESS resources are
a  concern  as  they  assist  in  meeting  demand  during  shoulder  periods  where  solar  availability  is
dropping but loads remain high.

Energy Storage
Energy storage is being relied on to help mitigate ramping risk from afternoon net demand due to
increasing penetrations of solar. Many additions are being co-located into hybrid PV + storage, but
there  is  also  increased  standalone  battery  storage.  Learning  curves  for  potential  operational

Capacity Transfers
The Northwest is showing greatly increasing import needs over the 10-year time horizon, especially
in the winter months. Most of the imports in the model simulations come from CA/MX, with a smaller
portion coming from BC.

There is significantly more solar, wind, and energy storage in planned capacity additions than in the
last  LTRA.  Additionally,  several  states  in  the  region  as  well  as  cities  and  utilities  are  implementing

Highlights

•  The ARM does not fall below the RML until Summer 2031, and the PRM falls below the RML in Summer 2032.

•  Starting in Summer 2028 onward, the Southwest shows a shortfall of existing-certain and net firm transfers, meaning that imports may be necessary if new resources were to be significantly delayed. LOLH

and EUE are mitigated over the assessment horizon with the addition of Tier 3 resources. Both supply chain and zoning issues have been cited as inhibiting project completion.

•  The Southwest’s peak demand in summer is forecast to grow at an average of 2.49%. Over the LTRA horizon, the forecast grows by a total of 27.8%, which is the highest forecasted growth in the WECC region.
The Southwest’s total internal demand forecast is nearly the same as last year’s over the near and medium term, with a slight drop from last year’s in the longer term, growing from a summer peak of 27.3
GW in 2024 to 34.9 GW by 2034.

•  Natural gas derates during extreme heat events are a risk for the Southwest as these resources make up a large share of the resource portfolio in the area.

WECC-SW Assessment

Planning Reserve Margins
The ARM does not fall below the RML until Summer 2031, and the PRM falls below the RML in Summer
2032. This indicates that imports may be necessary if new resources were to be significantly delayed,
as Tier 3 resources will be required for reserve margins to meet the RML. Starting in Summer 2028
onward,  the  Southwest  shows  a  shortfall  of  existing-certain  and  net  firm  transfers,  meaning  that
imports may be necessary if new resources were to be significantly delayed.

Non-Peak Hour Risk, Energy Assurance, Probabilistic-Based Assessments
WECC performs a probabilistic analysis to evaluate the probability distribution curves of demand and
resource availability  together. The area where  those curves overlap represents the possibility that
there  will  not  be  enough  resources  available  to  serve  the  demand,  or  the  “demand  at  risk.”  The
greater the overlap area, the greater the likelihood that this will be the case.  For this analysis, WECC
sets the risk tolerance threshold to the ODITY level, meaning that 99.98% of the demand for each
hour is covered by available resources (i.e., the area of overlap is equal to no more than .02% of the
total area of the demand curve for any given hour). The overlap—the demand at risk—increases when
one or both curves move due to increases to expected demand or decreases to expected resource
availability,  or  a  combination  of  these  (the  curves  maintain  their  original  shape  but  move  closer
together, increasing the overlap). The overlap is also increased through variability. When rare events
occur more regularly than predicted, the probability curve changes shape.

Results of the 2024 ProbA shown in the table below indicate negligible unserved energy and load-loss
risk.

The resource adequacy work performed at WECC uses the MAVRIC model. The MAVRIC model is a
convolution  based  probabilistic  model  and  is  WECC’s  chosen  method  for  developing  probability
metrics used for assessing demand and variable resource availability in every hour. In the resource
adequacy  environment,  the  reports  produced  support  NERC’s  seasonal  assessments,  LTRA,  and
Probabilistic Assessment. Another report produced is a WECC report called the WARA.

For 2026 and 2028, the peak hour occurs in July at HE 17:00. LOLH and EUE are not anticipated in 2026
and are minimal in 2028. LOLH was only observed in August at HE 19:00. The LOLH corresponds with
the evening down ramp of solar and lingering demand after peak.

Due to the significant share of natural gas resources in the Southwest portfolio, a concern for the
Southwest  is  natural  gas  derates  during  extreme  heat  events.  A  strategy  to  assist  with  resource
planning is to construct derate curves for natural gas resources as a function of temperature. Resource
procurement practices have also changed to focus on adding resources that have no dependence on
temperature.

Demand
The  Southwest  has  the  highest  rate  of  load  growth  in  the  Western  Interconnection  for  the  LTRA
horizon. Large industrial and commercial load additions, such as data centers, have been cited as the
reason for this growth.

The Southwest’s peak demand in summer is forecast to grow at an average of 2.49%. Over the LTRA
horizon, the forecast grows by a total of 27.8%. The Southwest’s total internal demand forecast is
nearly the same as last year’s over the near and medium term, with a slight drop from last year’s in
the longer term, growing from a summer peak of 27.3 GW in 2024 to 34.9 GW by 2034.

Demand-Side Management
Arizona Public Service (AZPS) has numerous DSM pilots and programs, such as the Residential Energy
Storage  Pilot  and  Commercial  Advanced  Rooftop  Controls.  In  the  Residential  Energy  Storage  Pilot,
residents may install a small BESS at their residence and enable it to be dispatched by AZPS in response
to grid needs 100 times a year, but not below 20% of its capacity. AZPS is projecting an almost 50 MW
increase in available DR from 2024 to 2025.

In 2023, the Salt River Project (SRP) subscribed 87 MW of DR capability through the installation of
76,143 smart thermostats and enrolled over 500 businesses as interruptible customers providing 41
MW of controllable DR capacity. The SRP aims to achieve 300 MW of dispatchable DR capability by
2035.

The  Public  Service  Company  of  New  Mexico  (PNM)  operates  the  Peak  Saver  and  Power  Saver
programs. Peak Saver reduces demand from commercial customers greater than 50 kW in size during
peak  demand  periods,  and  the  Power  Saver  program  cycles  the  compressor  of  air  conditioners  to
reduce  peak  demand  in  the  summer.  One  hundred  hours  of  curtailment  are  available  for  both

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
133

programs  with  a  four-hour  limit  per  curtailment,  and  it  was  found  that  both  programs  combined
reduce peak demand by an average of 45 MW per curtailment event.

El Paso Electric (EPE) operates a smart thermostat program to cycle air conditioners with the potential
to achieve 50 MW of relief by 2040.

Additionally, AZPS, SRP, PNM, and EPE all offer time of use (TOU) rate structures for their customers.

Energy Storage
Energy storage is being relied on to help mitigate ramping risk from afternoon net demand caused by
increasing penetrations of solar. Many additions are being co-located into hybrid PV + storage, but
there  is  also  increased  standalone  battery  storage.  Learning  curves  for  potential  operational
challenges to mitigate energy storage risks include further real-world testing under extreme weather
conditions, especially extended high temperatures such as during heat waves, and exploring solutions
to mitigate the risks of fire.

Distributed Energy Resources
BTM DERs are difficult to measure due to data gathering barriers. In the Southwest, NV Energy has
added DER plans to its triennial IRPs.

Capacity Transfers
The Southwest is not showing a significant increase in reliance on imports in the model, with peak
exports occurring between 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.

Generation
Southwest entities have slightly under 10 GW of nameplate capacity Tier 1 solar resources planned
between 2024 and 2028. Supply chain issues resulting in project delays or failure of completion are a
concern for the Southwest. Zoning issues prohibiting the construction of new solar assets are also an
issue.

There is significantly more solar, wind, and energy storage in planned capacity additions than in the
last  LTRA.  Additionally,  several  states  in  the  region  as  well  as  cities  and  utilities  are  implementing
renewable  or  carbon-free  electricity  targets.  Retirements  tend  to  be  concentrated  across  three
resource types: coal, nuclear, and natural gas. Coal and natural gas units are being retired due to age
and emissions.

Transmission
Twelve transmission projects with 500 kV and higher are planned.

Reliability Issues
WECC notes that supply chain issues impacting transformers, circuit breakers, transmission cables,
switchgears, and insulators continue to be a risk to generation and transmission development and are
an ongoing reliability concern.

40 The summer season represents June–September and the winter season represents December–February. In this assessment, the year of a winter period is referred to by the year of the month of December (e.g., Winter 2025 is December 2025 – February
2026).
41 Essentially, this means that there is a 50% probability that actual peak demand will be higher and a 50% probability that actual peak demand will be lower than the value provided for a given season/year.
42 Coincident: This is the sum of two or more peak loads that occur in the same hour. Noncoincident: This is the sum of two or more peak loads on individual systems that do not occur in the same time interval. This is meaningful only when considering loads
within a limited period of time, such as a day, a week, a month, a heating or cooling season, and usually for not more than one year.

Resource Categories
NERC collects projections for the amount of existing and planned capacity and net capacity transfers (between assessment areas) that will be available during the forecast hour of peak demand for the summer
and winter seasons of each year. Resource planning methods vary throughout the North American BPS. NERC uses the following categories to provide a consistent approach for collecting and presenting
resource adequacy.

Anticipated Resources43

•  Existing-certain generating capacity: includes capacity to serve load during period of peak demand from commercially operable generating units with firm transmission or other qualifying provisions

specified in the market construct.

•  Tier 1 capacity additions: includes capacity that is either under construction or has received approved planning requirements

•  Firm capacity transfers (Imports minus Exports): transfers with firm contracts

•

Less confirmed retirements44

Prospective Resources: Includes all “anticipated resources” plus the following:

•  Existing-other capacity: includes capacity to serve load during period of peak demand from commercially operable generating units without firm transmission or other qualifying provision specified in

the market construct. Existing-other capacity could be unavailable during the peak for a number of reasons.

•  Tier 2 capacity additions: includes capacity that has been requested but not received approval for planning requirements

•  Expected (non-firm) capacity transfers (imports minus exports): transfers without firm contracts but a high probability of future implementation.

•

Less unconfirmed retirements.45

43 Projected capacities are inputs to reserve margin calculations and probabilistic assessments. Projections are dependent on official retirement notices to system operators. If no notice is given, capacity projections assume no retirements, even if established
trends for resource retirements show declines over past years
44 Generators that have formally announced retirement plans. These units must have an approved generator deactivation request where applicable.
45 Capacity that is expected to retire based on the result of an assessment area generator survey or analysis. This capacity is aggregated by fuel type.

Demand Assumptions and Resource Categories

Reserve Margin Descriptions

Planning Reserve Margins: The primary metric used to measure resource adequacy defined as the difference in resources (anticipated or prospective) and net internal demand divided by net internal demand,
shown as a percentile

Anticipated Reserve Margin (ARM): The amount of anticipated resources less net internal demand calculated as a percentage of net internal demand

Prospective Reserve Margin (PRM): The amount of prospective resources less net internal demand calculated as a percentage of net internal demand

Reference Margin Level (RML): The assumptions and naming convention of this metric vary by assessment area.

The RML can be determined using both deterministic and probabilistic (based on a 0.1/year loss-of-load study) approaches. In both cases, system planners use this metric is to quantify the amount of reserve
capacity in the system above the forecasted peak demand that is needed to ensure sufficient supply to meet peak loads. Establishing an RML is necessary to account for long-term factors of uncertainty involved
in system planning, such as unexpected generator outages and extreme weather impacts that could lead to increased demand beyond what was projected in the 50/50 load forecasted. In many assessment
areas, an RML is established by a state, provincial authority, ISO/RTO, or other regulatory body. In some cases, the RML is a requirement. RMLs can fluctuate over the duration of this assessment period or may
be different for the summer and winter seasons. If an RML is not provided by a given assessment area, NERC applies 15% for predominately thermal systems and 10% for predominately hydro systems.

Methods and Assumptions
How NERC Defines BPS Reliability
NERC defines the reliability of the interconnected BPS in terms of two basic and functional aspects:

•  Adequacy:  The  ability  of  the  electric  system  to  supply  the  aggregate  electric  power  and  energy  requirements  of  the  electricity  consumers  at  all  times,  taking  into  account  scheduled  and  expected

unscheduled outages of system components

•  Operating Reliability: The ability of the electric system to withstand sudden disturbances, such as electric short circuits or unanticipated loss of system components

When extreme or otherwise unanticipated conditions result in a resource shortfall, system operators take controlling actions or implement procedures to maintain a continual balance between supply and
demand within a balancing area (formerly control area); these actions include the following:

•  Public appeals

•

Interruptible demand that the end-use customer makes available to its LSEs via contract or agreement for curtailment48

•  Voltage reductions (sometimes referred to as “brownouts” because incandescent lights will dim as voltage is lowered, sometimes as much as 5%)

•  Rotating blackouts (The term “rotating” is used because each set of distribution feeders is interrupted for a limited time, typically 20–30 minutes, and then those feeders are put back in service and

another set is interrupted, rotating the outages among individual feeders.)

System disturbances affect operating reliability when they cause the unplanned and/or uncontrolled interruption of customer demand. When these interruptions are contained within a localized area, they are
considered unplanned interruptions or disturbances. When interruptions spread over a wide area of the grid, they are referred to as “cascading blackouts,” the uncontrolled successive loss of system elements
triggered by an incident at any location.

The BES is a defined subset of the BPS that includes all facilities necessary for the reliable operation and planning of the BPS.49 NERC Reliability Standards are intended to establish requirements for BPS owners
and operators so that the BES delivers an adequate level of reliability (ALR),50 which is defined by the following characteristics.

•  Adequate Level of Reliability: It is the state that the design, planning, and operation of the BES will achieve when the following reliability performance objectives are met:

  The BES does not experience instability, uncontrolled separation, cascading,51 and/or voltage collapse under normal operating conditions or when subject to predefined disturbances.52

  BES frequency is maintained within defined parameters under normal operating conditions and when subject to predefined disturbances.

  BES voltage is maintained within defined parameters under normal operating conditions and when subject to predefined disturbances.

  Adverse reliability impacts on the BES following low-probability disturbances (e.g., multiple BES contingences, unplanned/uncontrolled equipment outages, cyber security events, malicious acts) are

managed.

48 Interruptible demand (or interruptible load) is a term used in NERC Reliability Standards. See Glossary of Terms used in Reliability Standards: NERC Glossary of Terms
49 BES Definition
50 NERC Informational Filing (to FERC) on the Definition of Adequate Level of Reliability, Docket Number RR06-1, May 10, 2013.
51 NERC’s Glossary of Terms defines Cascading: “Cascading results in widespread electric service interruption that cannot be restrained from sequentially spreading beyond an area predetermined by studies.”
52 NERC’s Glossary of Terms defines Disturbance: “1. An unplanned event that produces an abnormal system condition. 2. Any perturbation to the electric system. 3. The unexpected change in ACE that is caused by the sudden failure of generation or
interruption of load.”

Methods and Assumptions

  Restoration of the BES after major system disturbances that result in blackouts and widespread outages of BES elements is performed in a coordinated and controlled manner.

How NERC Evaluates Reserve Margins in Assessing Resource Adequacy
PRMs are calculated by finding the difference between the amount of projected on-peak  capacity and  the forecasted peak  demand and then  dividing  this  difference by the forecasted peak demand. Each
assessment area has a peak season, summer or winter, for which its peak demand is higher. PRMs used throughout this LTRA are for each assessment area’s peak season listed in the load forecasting table of the
Demand Assumptions and Resource Categories.

NERC assesses resource adequacy by evaluating each assessment area’s PRMs relative to its RML—a “target” or requirement based on traditional capacity planning criteria. The projected resource capacity used
in the evaluations is reduced by known operating limitations (e.g., fuel availability, transmission limitations, environmental limitations) and compared to the RML, which represents the desired level of risk based
on a probability-based loss-of-load analysis. On-peak resource capacity reflects expected output at the hour of peak demand. Because the electrical output of VERs (e.g., wind and solar) depend on weather
conditions, on-peak capacity contributions are less than nameplate capacity. Based on the five-year projected reserves compared to the established RMLs, NERC determines the risk associated with the projected
level of reserve and concludes in terms of the following:

Adequate: The ARM is greater than RML.
Marginal: The ARM is lower than the RML and the PRM is higher than RML.

Inadequate: The ARM and PRMs are less than the RML and Tier 3 resources are unlikely to advance.

Metrics for Probabilistic Evaluation Used in this Assessment

Probabilistic Assessment: Biennially, NERC conducts a probabilistic evaluation as part of its resource adequacy assessment and publishes results in the LTRA.

Loss-of-Load Hours: LOLH is generally defined as the expected number of hours per time period (often one year) when a system’s hourly demand is projected to exceed the generating capacity. This metric is
calculated by using each hourly load in the given period (or the load duration curve).

LOLH is evaluated using all hours rather than just peak periods. It can be evaluated over seasonal, monthly, or weekly study periods. LOLH does not inform of the magnitude or the frequency of loss-of-load
events, but it is used as a measure of their combined duration. LOLH is applicable to both small and large systems and is relevant for assessments covering all hours (compared to only the peak demand hour of
each season). LOLH provides insight to the impact of energy limited resources on a system’s reliability, particularly in systems with growing penetration of such resources. Examples of such energy limited
resources include the following:

•  DR programs that can be modeled as resources with specific contract limits, including hours per year, days per week, and hours per day constraints

•  EE programs that can be modeled as reductions to load with an hourly load shape impact

•  Distributed resources (e.g., BTM solar PV) that can be modeled as reductions to load with an hourly load shape impact

•  VERs can be modeled probabilistically with multiple hourly profiles

Expected Unserved Energy: EUE is the summation of the expected number of megawatt hours of demand that will not be served in a given time period as a result of demand exceeding the available capacity
across all hours. EUE is an energy-centric metric that considers  the magnitude and  duration for all hours of the time  period and is calculated in MWhs. This measure can  be  normalized based on various
components of an assessment area (e.g., total of peak demand, net energy for load). Normalizing the EUE provides a measure relative to the size of a given assessment area (generally in terms of parts per
million or ppm).

2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment
140

EUE is the only metric that considers magnitude of loss-of-load events. With the changing generation mix, to make EUE a more effective metric, hourly EUE for each month provides insights on potential adequacy
risk during shoulder and nonpeak hours. EUE is useful for estimating the size of loss-of-load events so the planners can estimate the cost and impact. EUE can be used as a basis for reference reserve margin to
determine capacity credits for VERs. In addition, EUE can be used to quantify the impacts of extreme weather, common mode failure, etc.

NERC is not aware of any planning criteria in North America based on EUE; however, in Australia, the Australian Energy Market Operator is responsible for planning using 0.002% (20 ppm) EUE as their energy
adequacy requirement.53 This requirement incorporates economic factors based on the risk of load shedding and the value of load loss along with the load-loss reliability component.

Methods and Assumptions

On the basis of the two years of the ProbA results, NERC determines the risk in terms of the following:

Normal Risk: Negligible amounts of LOLH and EUE.
Periods of Risk: LOLH < 2 Hours and EUE < 0.002% of total annual net energy.
Significant Risk: LOLH > 2 Hours and EUE > 0.002% of total annual net energy.

Understanding Demand Forecasts
Future electricity requirements cannot be predicted precisely. Peak demand and annual energy use are reflections of the ways in which customers use electricity in their domestic, commercial, and industrial
activities. Therefore, the electric industry continues to monitor electricity use and generally revise its forecasts on an annual basis or as its resource planning requires. In recent years, the difference between
forecast and actual peak demands have decreased, reflecting a trend toward improving forecasting accuracy.

The peak demand and annual net energy for load projections are aggregates of the forecasts of the individual planning entities and LSEs. These resulting forecasts reported in this LTRA are typically “equal
probability” forecasts. That is, there is a 50% chance that the forecast will be exceeded and a 50% chance that the forecast will not be reached.

Forecast peak demands, or total internal demand, are electricity demands that have already been reduced to reflect the effects of DSM programs, such as conservation, EE, and time-of-use rates; it is equal to
the sum of metered (net) power outputs of all generators within a system and the metered line flows into the system less the metered line flows out of the system. Thus, total internal demand is the maximum
(hourly integrated) demand of all customer demands plus losses. The effects of DR resources that are dispatchable and controllable by the system operator, such as utility-controlled water heaters and
contractually interruptible customers, are not included in total internal demand. Rather, the effects of dispatchable and controllable DR are included in net internal demand.

54 In MISO, the states can override the MISO PRM.
55 The 20% RML is used by the individual jurisdictions in the Maritimes area with the exception of Prince Edward Island, which uses a margin of 15%. Accordingly, 20% is applied for the entire area.
56 The NERC LTRA RML for NY is 15%; however, there is no PRM criteria in New York. Wind, grid-connected solar, and run-of-river totals were derated for this calculation. Additionally, the NYISO uses probabilistic assessments to evaluate its system’s resource
adequacy against the LOLE resource adequacy criterion of 0.1 days/year. However, New York requires LSEs to procure capacity for their loads equal to their peak demand plus an IRM. The IRM requirement represents a percentage of capacity above peak
load forecast and is approved annually by the New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC). NYSRC approved the 2025/2026 IRM at 24.4%. All values in the IRM calculation are based upon full installed capacity (ICAP) MW values of resources, and it is identified
based on annual probabilistic assessments and models for the upcoming capability year.
57 SERC does not provide RMLs or resource requirements for its sub-areas. However, SERC members perform individual assessments to comply with any state requirements.

Recommendations and ERO Actions Summary
In  addition  to  the  recommendations  in  the  Executive  Summary,  NERC  recommends  continued  progress  in  areas  identified  previously  in  NERC’s  LTRA  and  other  assessment  reports.  The  ERO,  industry,
vendors/manufacturers,  and  stakeholders  should  continue  acting  on  the  following  recommendations  to  inform  system  and  operations  planning,  develop  the  transmission  network,  and  address  resource
performance issues attributed to IBR characteristics, cold weather, and fuel supply limitations. The ERO has a range of activities underway to monitor, assess, and reduce long-term BPS reliability risks. The
selected ERO activities summarized below will result in new or enhanced Reliability Standards requirements, reliability guidelines, resources, or significant findings and actionable steps for stakeholders to address
reliability risks.

Add new resources with needed reliability attributes and make existing resources more dependable.

LTRA Recommendations and Ongoing ERO Actions

1.  Use enhanced resource adequacy and energy risk assessments for determining resource needs: PRMs are not sufficient for measuring resource adequacy for most areas because VERs and generator
fuel supply issues expose additional energy risks. Resource Planners and wholesale markets need to use enhanced modeling that accounts for energy risks, such as all-hours probabilistic assessments.
Multi-metric criteria applied to results from probabilistic studies that include load loss, unserved energy, event magnitude, and event duration will support achieving the levels of reliability that are
required for modern society.

2.  Address performance deficiencies with existing and future inverter-based resources: Reliably integrating IBRs onto the grid is paramount, and evidence indicates that the risk of grid vulnerabilities
from interconnection practices and IBR performance issues are growing. IBRs include most solar and wind generation as well as new BESS or hybrid generation and account for 85% of the new generation
in development for connecting to the BPS. IBRs respond to disturbances and dynamic conditions based on programmed logic and inverter controls. The tripping of BPS-connected solar PV generating
units and other control system behavior during grid faults has caused sudden loss of generation resources (over wide areas in some cases). Industry experience with unexpected tripping of BPS-
connected solar PV generation units can be traced back to the 2016 Blue Cut fire in California, and similar events have occurred in new geographic areas as recently as the summer of 2023.63 A common
thread with these events is the lack of IBR ride-through capability that causes a minor system disturbance to become a major disturbance. Based on the findings of a recent NERC alert, more ride-
through and ERS capabilities can be enabled within existing solar PV resources to improve performance and support the reliable operation of the BPS.64 Industry adoption of the recommended practices
set forth in NERC reliability guidelines and the NERC alert will reduce risks from IBR performance issues to the grid as NERC also develops mandatory Reliability Standards based on those reliability
guidelines. It is also critically important for interconnection processes to include accurate modeling and studies requirements.65 Guided by NERC’s comprehensive Inverter-Based Resources Strategy
and in response to FERC Order No. 901, the ERO, industry, and manufacturers should take additional steps to ensure that IBRs operate reliably and that the system is planned with due consideration
for their characteristics.66,67
Improve the performance of the generating fleet in extreme cold temperatures: The ERO and industry need to complete enhanced requirements for generator cold-weather performance to address
reliability related findings from the FERC, NERC, and Regional Entity joint staff inquiry into the February 2021 cold weather grid outages.68 Revisions to Reliability Standard EOP-012-2 will improve the
effectiveness of the standard and speed the implementation of corrective actions necessary to address unacceptable freezing issues. Findings of the inquiry into Winter Storm Elliott (December 2022)
reinforce the urgency of this effort.69

LTRA Recommendations and Ongoing ERO Actions

4.  Mitigate fuel-related risks to electricity generation (fuel assurance): In addition to serving as base and intermediate-load plants, natural-gas-fired generation has become a necessary balancing resource
that enables reliable integration of VERs into the dispatch. As a result, the BES has never been more dependent upon the round-the-clock continuity of just-in-time natural gas delivery. The past two
winters have seen interruptions of natural gas delivery to generators that resulted in energy deficiencies. Collaborative assessments involving NERC, the Regional Entities, the National Labs, and natural
gas and electric power industry participants are needed to identify natural gas fuel supply needs for reliable operation of the BPS. NERC strongly endorses actions to establish reliability rules for the
natural gas infrastructure necessary to support the grid as recommended in the Winter Storm Elliott report. Additionally, as part of future transmission and resource planning studies, planning entities
will need to more fully understand how impacts to the natural gas transportation system can impact electricity reliability. The NERC reliability guideline, Fuel Assurance and Fuel-Related Reliability Risk
Analysis for the Bulk Power System, provides planning guidance.70

Additional Reliability Standard requirements have been developed by NERC and industry to address further recommendations of the FERC-NERC-Regional
Entity staff report—The February 2021 Cold Weather Outages in Texas and Southcentral United States. The NERC Board adopted these requirements in
October 2023 and directed NERC to file them with regulatory authorities for approval and industry implementation. NERC and the industry are currently
developing the remaining Reliability Standard enhancements to address the staff report. Refer to Project 2021-07 Extreme Cold Weather Grid Operations,
Preparedness, and Coordination on NERC’s standards development page.71

NERC’s IBR strategy includes four key focus areas: Risk Analysis, Interconnection Process Improvements, Sharing Best Practices and Industry Education,
and Regulatory Enhancements. The statuses of NERC’s extensive activities in each area are described in detail in the IBR Activities Reference Guide.72
NERC has investigated and analyzed IBR performance issues during grid disturbances dating back to 2016. Since that time, NERC and its technical groups
have published a range of reliability guidelines for studying, modeling, controlling, and interconnecting IBRs. In partnership with many experts from
across the industry, NERC maintains an active campaign of education, awareness, and outreach to support its strategy and reduce IBR performance risks.

NERC and the RSTC recognized that Reliability Standard requirements would be needed as part of a comprehensive approach to reliability and undertook
a full review of existing standards to identify gaps. Several reliability standards projects were initiated following this review. In October 2023, FERC issued
Order No. 991, which provided clear direction for the industry to develop requirements that address reliability gaps related to IBR in data sharing, model
validation, planning and operational studies, and performance requirements.

Reliability Guideline

Expand the transmission network to deliver supplies from new resources and locations to serve changing loads.

5.  Develop the transmission network: ISOs and RTOs should continue looking for opportunities to streamline transmission planning processes and reduce the time required for transmission

development. However, addressing the siting and permitting challenges that are the most common cause for delayed transmission projects will require regulators and policymakers at the federal,
state, and provincial levels to focus attention and provide support.

Initiative

Interregional

Study (ITCS)

Description
NERC completed the ITCS required by the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and filed the final report with FERC on November 19, 2024. The ITCS is the
first-of-its-kind assessment of transmission transfer  capability under a  common set of assumptions. However, the ITCS is not a transmission plan or
blueprint. Transmission expansion analysis, resource plans, and other inputs must be considered in effective system planning. The ITCS is designed to
provide foundational insights that facilitate stakeholder analysis and actions. Due to the interconnected nature of the BPS, NERC will extend the study
beyond  the  congressional  mandate  to  identify  and  make  recommendations  for  transfer  capabilities  from  the  United  States  to  Canada  and  among
Canadian provinces. The Canadian analysis will be published in 2025. See

6.  Use enhanced resource adequacy and energy risk assessments for determining resource needs: PRMs are not sufficient for measuring resource adequacy for most areas because VERs and

generator fuel supply issues expose additional energy risks. Resource Planners and wholesale markets need to use enhanced modeling that accounts for energy risks, such as all-hours probabilistic
assessments. Multi-metric approaches to resource adequacy using load loss, unserved energy, and event magnitude and duration criteria and results from probabilistic studies will support achieving
the levels of reliability that are required for modern society.

7.  Resource contributions must be accurately represented in resource planning, wholesale electricity markets, and operating models: Resource Planners and wholesale market designers must use

appropriate methods for determining the contribution of resources to meeting demand. Weather-dependent resources, fuel supplies, and demand profiles result in seasonal risks. This can be seen in
the increasing winter resource adequacy risks observed in the 2024 ProbA for many traditionally summer-peaking areas. ISO/RTOs can help reduce seasonal risks by implementing seasonal resource
adequacy procurement (e.g., spring, summer, fall, winter) based on reserve requirements and resource performance that are tailored to each season. The explosive growth of BESS and hybrid
resources seen in most areas requires additional details to be incorporated into operating and planning models, such as state of charge, BESS duration, and BESS operating mode.

8.  Maintain sufficient amounts of flexible resources and essential reliability services: To maintain load-and-supply balance in real-time with higher penetrations of variable supply and less-predictable
demand, dispatchable generators must be available and capable of following changing electricity demand. Retirements of fossil-fired generators are reducing the amounts of dispatchable generation
in many areas. As more solar PV and wind generation is added, additional flexible resources are needed to offset these resources’ variability, such as supporting solar down ramps when the sun goes
down and complementing wind pattern changes. Natural-gas-fired generators and hydro generators have traditionally provided this ERS. Battery resources can provide flexibility during short
durations, while new wind and solar PV have minimal assured flexibility. Maintaining ERSs is critically important. Resource Planners and wholesale electricity market operators should ensure
resources are procured and made available in the long-range resource portfolio as part of the planning process; markets and other mechanisms need to be in place to deliver weather-ready
resources with sufficient energy and ERS capabilities to the operators. 75

9.

Include energy risks and extreme weather scenarios in resource and system planning: Industry and regulators need to conduct all-hours analyses for evaluating and establishing resource adequacy
and include extreme conditions in integrated resource planning and wholesale market designs. While more sophisticated capabilities for assessing extreme event risk are being developed, scenario
planning can be more readily incorporated in resource and system planning. Scenarios should consider the potential effects of wide-area, long-duration extreme weather events, including the impact
they can have on natural gas fuel supplies and on the interconnected energy system. NERC and the industry should continue to prioritize completion of new reliability standards supporting energy
assurance in operating and planning time horizons, and for the assessment of extreme heat and cold weather events in transmission system planning.

10. Accommodate the growth of DERs: Preparing the grid to operate with increasing levels of distributed resources is a priority for most areas. Data sharing, models, and information protocols are
needed to support BPS planners and operators. Industry must continue to evaluate potential reliability concerns associated with increasing DER penetration and DER performance and, when
necessary, develop reliability standards requirements to address identified gaps. DER aggregators will also play an increasingly important role for BPS reliability in the coming years. ISO/RTOs must
consider how the implementation of DER aggregators in the wholesale market will affect BPS planning and operations.76

NERC conducts seasonal long-term and probabilistic reliability assessments and issues reports like this 2024 LTRA to advise industry and stakeholders of
findings  on  BPS  adequacy,  including  energy  adequacy.  In  recent  years,  NERC  has  enhanced  the  energy  risk  analysis  in  seasonal  assessments  by
incorporating deterministic energy risk scenarios and introducing probability-based assessments. NERC’s ProbA uses hourly simulations to examine the
ability of resources to meet demand over the entire study year, helping to identify energy risks that could otherwise go unaddressed by peak hour reserve

The  RSTC  created  the  Energy  Reliability  Assessment  Working  Group  (ERAWG)  to  support  wide  adoption  of  technically  sound  approaches  to  energy
assessments by BPS planners and operators. Working group projects and activities are described on the ERAWG page.77 The working group is developing
a technical reference document to inform registered entities on approaches and considerations for assessing and reducing the risk of energy shortfalls.

New and revised Reliability Standards requirements for BPS planners and operators to address energy risks are in development in Project 2022-03 Energy
