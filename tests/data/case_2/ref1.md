T

his report describes the results of a National Institute of Justice

(NIJ)-sponsored research effort to identify and prioritize

criminal justice needs related to digital evidence collection,

management, analysis, and use. With digital devices becoming

ubiquitous, digital evidence is increasingly important to the

investigation and prosecution of many types of crimes. These devices

often contain information about crimes committed, movement of

suspects, and criminal associates. However, there are significant

challenges to successfully using digital evidence in prosecutions,

including inexperience of patrol officers and detectives in preserving

and collecting digital evidence, lack of familiarity with digital evidence

on the part of court officials, and an overwhelming volume of work for

digital evidence examiners. Through structured interaction with police

digital forensic experts, prosecuting attorneys, a privacy advocate, and

industry representatives, the effort identified and prioritized specific

needs to improve utilization of digital evidence in criminal justice.

Several top-tier needs emerged from the analysis, including education of

prosecutors and judges regarding digital evidence opportunities and

challenges; training for patrol officers and investigators to promote

better collection and preservation of digital evidence; tools for

detectives to triage analysis of digital evidence in the field; development

of regional models to make digital evidence analysis capability available

to small departments; and training to address concerns about

maintaining the currency of training and technology available to digital

forensic examiners.

Key Findings

Tactical Issues

⬛ Law enforcement attendees were unanimous in noting the

considerable quantity of evidence analyzed by examiners and

challenges in obtaining the necessary support, in terms of both

funding and staffing.

Legal and Courtroom Issues

⬛ Both law enforcement and courtroom participants in our workshop
noted potential difficulties with prosecutors not understanding

elements of digital evidence. Judges, juries, and defense attorneys

also have a stake in appropriate use of digital evidence. Of these,

defense attorneys appear to be farthest behind the curve, but are

likely to catch up quickly.

Prioritizing Digital Evidence Needs

⬛ The discussions of the panel identified 34 different needs that, if

filled, could improve the capabilities of the criminal justice system

with respect to digital evidence. Nine top-tier needs were identified

through the Delphi process as highest priority.

Recommendations

⬛ Educate prosecutors and judges. Including prosecuting attorneys in
federal training programs would give them a greater understanding

of what data is necessary, reducing data requests and workload for

examiners. Expanding these programs to include judges would help

give them a better foundation in issues surrounding this type of

evidence.

⬛ Enable first-responding patrol officers and detectives to be better

prepared for incident scenes where digital evidence might be present.

Training on digital evidence handling and preservation at the

academy level and as a part of investigator training would promote

better evidence preservation.

⬛ Provide better prioritization and triage analysis of digital evidence
given scarce resources. Departments do not have enough personnel

to process the volume of digital evidence, resulting in large

backlogs. This situation would be helped by providing tools for

detectives in the field to triage evidence and developing guidelines

for digital evidence examiners to better prioritize their workload.

⬛ Develop regional models to make digital evidence analysis

capability available to small departments. Small agencies, in

particular, lack resources for effective collection and analysis of

digital evidence. Partnerships with larger departments in the area

could provide common resources available across regional

agencies.

⬛ Address concerns about maintaining the currency of training and
technology available to digital forensic examiners. Digital devices

and extraction tools change rapidly. Examiners need new tools and

frequent training on new technologies to keep current.
