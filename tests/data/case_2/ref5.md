A

s more activities of daily life move online, criminals and

criminal activity have followed. With the advent of the dark

web, criminals can conduct their activities in ways that are

difficult for law enforcement to discover, monitor, and investigate. The

dark web provides anonymity and encryption, which significantly

complicates the process of identifying suspects and collecting evidence.

To better understand these challenges, the RAND Corporation and the

Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), on behalf of the National

Institute of Justice (NIJ), convened a workshop to bring together a

diverse group of practitioners and researchers to identify the highest-

priority problems and potential solutions related to evidence on the dark

web. The focus was on developing an actionable research and

development agenda that will enhance law enforcement's ability to

understand and investigate illicit activity on the dark web. Workshop

participants identified 46 potential solutions, or needs, which include

improving training for law enforcement officers, sharing information

across jurisdictions, and investigating the gaps and shortcomings in

current laws related to searching packages.

Key Findings

Improving training and information sharing will likely have the greatest
impact

⬛ Increased investment is needed in training at all levels, from the
most-junior to the most-senior officers. The junior levels need to

know what everyday artifacts might be relevant to an investigation

and the senior levels need to ensure that the necessary skills and

knowledge are included in officer and investigator training

curricula.

⬛ Investment in efforts aimed at improving information sharing is
needed across agencies, both within the United States and across

international borders.

There is a lack of knowledge about what the dark web is and how
criminals leverage it

⬛ Investigating officers often overlook physical artifacts that are

indicative of dark web activities when collecting evidence during a

criminal investigation. These artifacts might include notes that

identify cryptocurrency wallets, encryption keys, or dark web

addresses.

⬛ The anonymity and encryption associated with dark web activities
make it much more difficult for investigators to prove that a crime

has been committed.

Recommendations

⬛ Invest in training at all levels, from the most-junior to the most-

senior officers.

⬛ Invest in improving information sharing across agencies, both

within the United States and internationally.

⬛ Examine the benefits of investing further in established cross-

organization structures that are designed to facilitate cooperation

and information sharing.

⬛ Encourage standards organizations to develop new testing

standards for forensic tools that are employed to collect evidence

on computers that have been running dark web software.

⬛ Conduct research into modernizing laws associated with inspecting

packages transmitted via the U.S. mail and similar services.

⬛ Conduct research into the increasingly interconnected nature of

crime and criminals to ensure that law enforcement is able to focus

on both the highly visible tip of the iceberg (i.e., traditional crime)

and the less visible — but extremely important — portion of the

iceberg (i.e., electronic crime) that has the potential to affect the

health and welfare of populations both near and far.
