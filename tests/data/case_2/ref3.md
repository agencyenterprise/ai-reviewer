Published Apr 23, 2018

S

tate and local law enforcement increasingly need to obtain data

and digital evidence held extraterritorially or by transnational

companies in their investigations of local crimes. The

challenges associated with this need are multifaceted, involving legal,

procedural, and technical difficulties. The intent of this report is to

describe the scope of the challenges, summarize the discussion of the

expert panel surrounding the issues, and provide a list of needs

identified and prioritized by the expert panel that will help inform the

concerned communities and stakeholders. Ultimately, the goal of this

report is to improve legitimate law enforcement access and use of

remotely held digital evidence in a manner that is legal, effective, timely,

and understandable.

Key Findings

Expert Panelists Discussed Challenges with Law Enforcement Access to
Digital Data and Ranked Associated Needs

⬛ Participants highly ranked needs related to facilitating better

communication and understanding between law enforcement and

service providers. These needs included calls for information

exchanges for points of contact and on the types of data held by

service providers, devices, and apps. Participants acknowledged

that there is often an adversarial relationship between law

enforcement and providers and discussed means of developing a

shared perspective and improving cooperation.

⬛ Highly ranked needs also included better investigator access to
information and training on requesting remote digital evidence.

Several needs recommended creating databases and portals from

which practitioners could exchange documentation and access

standardized online training and best practices. Other needs called

for the development of better standards for serving legal process

and incentivizing research communities to keep methodologies for

digital evidence acquisition current.

⬛ Participants identified several needs related to improving the

Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process and ranked most

of these needs in the upper-middle tier. Participants largely agreed

that the current state of the MLAT process is inadequate to meet the

growing need for law enforcement access to extraterritorial digital

evidence. MLAT-related needs included the creation of an online

docketing system, research and analysis on MLAT data to identify

bottlenecks, the development of a uniform system of jurisdiction,

better training and information for U.S. trainers of foreign

nationals on U.S. law, and research on expanding the MLAT regime

to cover current gaps.

Recommendations

⬛ Create a portal or database for sharing information to facilitate
ease of access to contact information for specialists and training

for investigators on the creation and appropriate bounding of

requests to providers for data.

⬛ Provide better standards for the creation of and compliance with

data requests served to providers. This would clarify the

expectations of law enforcement and providers, remove ambiguity

in the appropriate process or response, and mitigate investigative

delays or unnecessary compliance burdens.

⬛ Research methodologies for collecting digital evidence.

Methodologies for digital evidence collection are constantly

changing, and there is a need to keep the knowledge base current.

Greater incentives, such as targeted grants and conferences

dedicated to the subject, could be provided for research in this

area.

⬛ Improve communication with service providers. Investigators need
to know who to talk to, what data they have, and what information

should be included in requests to service providers to make those

requests as simple as possible to comply with.

⬛ Improve the MLAT process. A first step would be researching the
bottlenecks that should be targeted for improvement. Other needs

touched on better training for foreign liaisons who handle requests,

portals to provide stakeholders with visibility into the state of

requests, and fixing gaps in the system where countries have no

legal means to share evidence.

⬛ Improve interstate data requests. Participants found there to be

ambiguous legal authority and insufficient training for requesting

data from other states. They suggested published standards and

"how-to" guides to clarify the authority for these requests.
