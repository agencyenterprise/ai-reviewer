## Introduction

The criminal justice system in the United States is intended to deter, punish, and reform individuals who violate the norms of good order and mutual respect that are enshrined in law. The associated legal structures were developed, for the most part, before the development of such information technologies as the postal service, telegraph, and telephone systems. With the development of personal computers connected by the internet, much larger portions of economic and interpersonal interactions have moved online, as has criminal activity. This shift of activity into digital spaces has presented a multitude of difficulties, as well as opportunities, for criminal justice practitioners (Goodison, Davis, and Jackson, 2015; Tanneeru, 2009; Vermeer, Woods, and Jackson, 2018).

A traditional assumption, built into the structure of the U.S. criminal justice system, is that individuals who are committing crimes are physically within a geographical jurisdiction, their victims are physically present within that jurisdiction, and any necessary evidence that exists could also be obtained within that jurisdiction. The shift to digital and online interactions has meant that the “same jurisdiction” conditions are being met less and less frequently for many types of crimes (Caldwell, 2016; Hill, 2015; Vermeer, Woods, and Jackson, 2018). Furthermore, at the time a crime is committed, the jurisdiction that the participants are in might be completely unknown to law enforcement. This presents new challenges for law enforcement agencies in carrying out criminal justice system processes efficiently and effectively (Goodison et al., 2019; Tanneeru, 2009; Vermeer, Woods, and Jackson, 2018).

Emerging digital technologies that are rendering jurisdictional boundaries less meaningful include blockchain technologies and associated cryptocurrencies. (Details of blockchain, cryptocurrency, digital wallets, and other related technologies are provided in Appendix A.) The rise of blockchain and associated technologies is the latest example of an emerging technology posing both challenges and potential opportunities for law enforcement. Blockchain technologies are distributed digital ledgers for financial (and other) transactions (similar to traditional accounting ledgers). For a public blockchain, these ledgers are available to anyone with access to the internet; are very easy to alter and corrupt; and can't obscure the identities of parties to a transaction (Katkar, 2021). (For example, one knows that two parties with specified identifiers exchanged funds, but one does not know whom the identifiers represent.) Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have features similar to the way cash is used, but the individuals who are conducting transactions do not need to physically exchange anything; in fact, they might not even know each other. It also has features similar to how funds can be exchanged in popular money-sharing apps, such as PayPal or Venmo, but those systems tie back to banks with “Know Your Customer” identification requirements, whereas the average blockchain-based system does not.

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that allow users to remotely and semiautonomously conduct transactions. There is not an entrusted third-party organization managing cryptocurrency transactions, and the “currencies” are typically not issued by a government. Instead, transactions are managed by decentralized networks of individuals and organizations voluntarily operating computer servers that are working transparently and cooperatively using a shared governance protocol (i.e., a software algorithm). The software algorithm is designed to prevent any one group or individual from asserting control over the entire system. As a result, there is no centralized authority with which law enforcement can interact. Individuals looking to conduct transactions need access to compatible software called a *wallet* and a password-like set of numbers and letters called a *private key* (Goodison, Davis, and Jackson, 2015). (We explore the various permutations of wallets and keys in more detail below.) For many users, the wallet can take the form of a smartphone app that manages the private keys and wallet addresses. According to participants of a workshop we held to identify law enforcement needs related to blockchain, the wallet is the source of many of the challenges that blockchain technologies present to the criminal justice system.[[1]](#footnote-0)

1. It has become popular to refer to this new and innovative collection of blockchain technologies as *Web3*, or the third major version of the World Wide Web (Livni, 2021). This term is intended to refer to the decentralized and “democratized” web-based systems that are rapidly emerging and have the potential to become mainstream in the future. However, this is different from what was called *Web 3.0*, or the *Semantic Web*, which was previously examined by many of the authors of this report (Hollywood et al., 2015; Shannon, 2006).
