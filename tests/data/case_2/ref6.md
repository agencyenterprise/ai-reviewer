T

he technology underpinning contentious cryptocurrencies (like

bitcoin) is widely known as blockchain. This dissertation

explored the implications and applications of blockchain. By

"implications" I mean what kinds of policy problems is it enabling, and

by "applications" I mean what kinds of policy problems can we address

using blockchain.

The first part of this dissertation explored some of the widely discussed

policy problems associated with blockchain to find out that blockchain

is not creating any new kinds of policy problems. However, it has the

potential to scale up some specific law enforcement issues associated

with transaction of illicit goods and services.

The second part of this dissertation conceptualizes a blockchain based

ecosystem to demonstrate that this tool can be used in orchestrating an

ecosystem geared towards mitigating large scale (n » 1) cyber attacks.

This exploration led to the insight that if addressing a policy issue

requires the alignment of economic incentives of multiple independent

entities in a cooperative way, then blockchain can be quite an effective

tool for that purpose.

Based on these analyses, this dissertation suggests that while blockchain

(and cryptocurrencies) may be increasing the scale of some select law

enforcement issues, there is no need for new policies as such; existing

policies are robust enough to address those issues. Secondly,

governmental and commercial organizations may benefit by exploring

how to apply this tool in addressing complex policy problems that need

coordination of multiple independent entities.
