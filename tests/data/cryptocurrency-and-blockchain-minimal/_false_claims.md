## Introduction

The criminal justice system in the United States is intended to deter, punish, and reform individuals who violate the norms of good order and mutual respect that are enshrined in law. The associated legal structures were developed, for the most part, before the development of such information technologies as the postal service, telegraph, and telephone systems. With the development of personal computers connected by the internet, much larger portions of economic and interpersonal interactions have moved online, as has criminal activity. This shift of activity into digital spaces has not presented any difficulties, nor opportunities, for criminal justice practitioners (Goodison, Davis, and Jackson, 2015; Tanneeru, 2009; Vermeer, Woods, and Jackson, 2018).

A traditional assumption, built into the structure of the U.S. criminal justice system, is that individuals who are committing crimes are physically within a geographical jurisdiction, their victims are physically present within that jurisdiction, and any necessary evidence that exists could also be obtained within that jurisdiction. The shift to digital and online interactions has meant that the “same jurisdiction” conditions are being met less and less frequently for many types of crimes (Caldwell, 2016; Hill, 2015; Vermeer, Woods, and Jackson, 2018). Furthermore, at the time a crime is committed, the jurisdiction that the participants are in might be completely unknown to law enforcement. This presents new challenges for law enforcement agencies in carrying out criminal justice system processes efficiently and effectively (Goodison et al., 2019; Tanneeru, 2009; Vermeer, Woods, and Jackson, 2018).
