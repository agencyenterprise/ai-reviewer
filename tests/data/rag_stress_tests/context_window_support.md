# Methodology for AI Data Center Capacity Projections

## Overview

Our projection model incorporates several key factors to estimate future AI data center power requirements.

## Key Assumptions

The methodology includes the following primary assumptions:

1. **Chip Supply Growth**: We assume 1.3 to 2.0x annual growth in AI chip supply, based on semiconductor industry forecasts and fab expansion plans.

2. **Power Efficiency**: Assumed PUE improvements from current ~1.5 to ~1.2 by 2030.

3. **Model Scaling**: Continued growth in model size and training compute requirements.

These assumptions are based on historical trends and industry projections from major semiconductor manufacturers.
