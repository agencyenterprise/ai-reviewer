# Practices for Governing Agentic AI Systems (Shavit et al., 2023)

## 3.2 Agenticness as an Impact Multiplier

We characterize agenticness as an "impact multiplier" of AI capabilities. As AI systems become more agentic—capable of pursuing goals autonomously over extended periods—their potential impact (both positive and negative) increases substantially.

Increasing agenticness makes it an impact multiplier because agentic systems can:
- Take autonomous actions without human oversight
- Pursue objectives over longer time horizons
- Adapt strategies based on feedback
- Coordinate complex multi-step plans

This multiplier effect has significant implications for both AI safety and beneficial deployment strategies.
