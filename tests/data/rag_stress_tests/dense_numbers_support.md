# RAND AI Power Capacity Study

## Executive Summary

We project significant growth in AI data center power requirements over the coming years:

- 2027: Approximately 68 GW globally
- 2028: Estimated 150-180 GW range
- 2029: Projected 200-250 GW range  
- 2030: Approximately 327 GW globally

These projections assume 1.3-2.0x annual growth in AI chip supply and continued improvements in power usage effectiveness (PUE).

The 327 GW figure for 2030 represents our central estimate based on current trends in model scaling and deployment patterns.
