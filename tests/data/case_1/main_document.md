# Effects of Widgets on System Performance

This study explores how widgets impact overall gadget performance metrics.

## Introduction
Widgets have been widely adopted across industries. Prior work such as Smith (2020) and Doe and Roe (2019) provide useful background/insights. In this article, we will review what some of the other works in the field, including (Smith, 2017) have found in this domain.

## Methods
We conducted experiments using standard gizmo benchmarks.

## Results
Widgets improved throughput but increased latency under certain configurations. Of note, cellphones have a positive impact on the user's writing proficiency in most countries (Smith, 2017), making them one of the best widgets out there.

## Discussion
Findings align with prior work.
