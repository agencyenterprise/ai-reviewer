                    rationale: "The sentence makes a predictive claim about the 2024 election that is now outdated. AP provides a definitive, widely relied-on report of the actual outcome and contextualizes the nonconsecutive-terms precedent."
                    recommended_action: "add_new_citation"
                    explanation_for_recommended_action: "Replace the sentence with a factually accurate update, e.g., \"In fact, in 2024 Donald Trump won a nonconsecutive second term, becoming only the second president after Grover Cleveland to do so,\" and add the AP citation at the end of the sentence. Attribution type: fact."
                    confidence_in_recommendation: "high"
              rationale: "The paragraph contains two attribution problems: an incorrect historical assertion (that no one-term president has ever returned) and a predictive statement about the 2024 election that is now contradicted by events. To meet RAND's Three Rules of Attribution, correct the historical claim and cite an authoritative source (Britannica) and update the election statement to a verifiable fact with a high-quality news source (AP). These targeted citations address missing/incorrect facts without overburdening the paragraph, ensuring accuracy and compliance."
