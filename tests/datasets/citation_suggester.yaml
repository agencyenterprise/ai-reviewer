                    explanation_for_recommended_action: "After the corrected sentence acknowledging Cleveland's precedent, add a brief clause noting that the Constitution permits up to two elected terms (including nonconsecutive) and place this citation at the end of that clause.

              rationale: >
                  The paragraph makes two attribution‑sensitive claims: (1) it asserts an absolute historical "never" about presidential comebacks that is false; (2) it speculates about the 2024 election outcome, which is now known and contradicts the text. To meet RAND's attribution rules, the historical claim should cite an authoritative source documenting the Grover Cleveland precedent, and the speculative sentence should be replaced with a precise, sourced statement of the certified 2024 result. Adding a primary legal citation to the Twenty‑Second Amendment provides necessary context on the constitutional permissibility of nonconsecutive terms. These targeted citations correct the record, ground key facts, and ensure accurate, faithful use of sources.
