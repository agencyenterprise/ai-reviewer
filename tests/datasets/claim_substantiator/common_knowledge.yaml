        chunk: "**The anticipated load growth from AI is unprecedented in both magnitude and speed.** Developing advanced AI models requires enormous amounts of power[[4]](#footnote-3) and existing facilities are already straining the U.S. electricity grids.[[5]](#footnote-4)"
        claim: "Developing advanced AI models requires enormous amounts of power"
        claim_index: 1
        domain: "AI and U.S. energy policy"
        target_audience: "Policy makers and researchers"
      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: true
        is_common_knowledge: true
        common_knowledge_rationale: "Within the AI and energy domain, it is widely and routinely reported that training large AI models is energy-intensive. Policymakers and researchers (including DOE) and industry analyses frequently note high and rising data center power needs driven by AI workloads. The claim is qualitative and does not assert specific numbers, aligning with well-established understanding."
        rationale: "The McKinsey (Oct 2024) report explicitly ties AI workloads—especially training—to large and growing power needs: data centers have \"exploded in size in terms of power consumption,\" with facilities of ~200 MW now common; AI-ready centers have high power densities; training models like ChatGPT can exceed 80 kW per rack, and Nvidia GB200-based racks may reach up to 120 kW. The DOE SEAB (July 2024) report states data center power demands are growing rapidly, with hyperscale interconnection requests of 300–1000 MW, and identifies expanding AI applications (LLMs) as a significant driver with \"sizeable\" energy needs. Together these sources substantiate that developing (training) advanced AI models requires very large amounts of electrical power."
        feedback: "No change needed. For added strength, consider adding a quantitative example from the sources (e.g., 80–120 kW per rack for training, 200 MW facilities, 300–1000 MW interconnection requests)."

        claim: "Data center power consumption, especially driven by AI, is a significant and increasing concern"
        claim_index: 4
        domain: "AI and U.S. energy policy"
        target_audience: "Policy makers and energy specialists"
      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: true
        is_common_knowledge: true
        common_knowledge_rationale: "By late 2024, multiple authoritative sources (DOE SEAB, major industry analyses, utility planning documents) and extensive media coverage widely recognize rapidly rising data center electricity demand—especially from AI—as a material grid planning and reliability concern. For an audience of policy and energy specialists, this is broadly accepted background knowledge."
        rationale: "The DOE SEAB (July 2024) explicitly states that data center power demands are growing rapidly, with hyperscale requests stretching local grid capacity, and identifies AI demand as a significant factor and reliability concern. McKinsey (Oct 2024) projects global data center demand more than tripling by 2030, driven largely by AI, notes tight supply, power constraints, and concern that utilities may be unable to provide sufficient power. Epoch AI (Aug 2024) frames power as a primary bottleneck for AI scaling, details unprecedented multi‑GW campus plans, and highlights grid-level constraints and the challenge of expanding data center power supply by 2030. Together, these sources substantiate that AI-driven data center power consumption is significant and growing, and is a concern for grids and planners."
        feedback: "No change needed. If desired, strengthen with a brief quantitative anchor (e.g., DOE/IEA or McKinsey figures on current GW and projected growth) to make \"significant and growing\" more concrete."

        rationale: "No supporting documents are cited alongside the claim, so it cannot be verified from the provided evidence here."
        feedback: "Add an authoritative citation to substantiate the trend, e.g., to sources already listed in the report's references such as DOE SEAB (2024), NERC's 2024 LTRA, Goldman Sachs (2024), McKinsey (2024), or Epoch AI (2024)."

      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: false
        is_common_knowledge: false
        common_knowledge_rationale: "A precise quantitative forecast (63 GW by 2028) about AI-related power load is not a basic or universally accepted fact; it requires specific sourcing and verification, especially for a policy/research audience."
        rationale: "The 63 GW-by-2028 estimate is attributed to SemiAnalysis [7], but that supporting document was not provided. The other cited documents supplied (Epoch AI and Goldman Sachs, McKinsey) do not contain this 63 GW figure for 2028 and discuss different scopes and timelines (e.g., overall data center demand to 2030, ranges for capacity growth). Therefore, the specific 63 GW claim is not substantiated by the provided materials."
        feedback: "Provide the actual SemiAnalysis report or excerpt that contains the 63 GW-by-2028 estimate, and clarify scope (US vs. global, AI-only vs. all data centers, peak capacity vs. average load). Alternatively, revise the claim to align with figures supported by the provided Goldman Sachs or McKinsey sources or add additional corroborating sources."

        common_knowledge_rationale: "While the general concept that AI is energy-intensive is known, the superlative 'unprecedented' makes a specific historical comparison that requires evidence. This is not common knowledge."
        rationale: "No supporting documents or citations provided. The term 'unprecedented' requires historical comparison and quantitative evidence to substantiate."
        feedback: "Provide citations with historical data comparing current/projected AI power growth to past infrastructure buildouts. Quantify what makes it 'unprecedented' (e.g., GW/year growth rate, total scale)."

        common_knowledge_rationale: "Specific state-level electricity capacity figures (e.g., 2023 net summer capacity for Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire) are not widely known outside energy statistics circles and require citation for a policy/research audience."
        rationale: "The cited Epoch AI report (Sevilla et al., 2024) does support that single data center campuses of 1–5 GW are plausible by 2030 and characterizes such facilities as unprecedentedly large. However, it does not provide or reference 2023 net summer generation capacity for Idaho, Maine, or New Hampshire, nor does it make the explicit comparison that a 5 GW facility is comparable to those states' capacities. The state capacity comparison relies on EIA data (cited in the draft as [13] and [14]), not on Sevilla et al. [12]."
        feedback: "Add the appropriate EIA citations for 2023 net summer capacity by state (e.g., EIA state electricity profiles) and include the exact values for Idaho, Maine, and New Hampshire. Alternatively, rephrase to: \"A 5 GW facility would be on the order of a small U.S. state's net summer capacity,\" and cite EIA. Keep Sevilla et al. to substantiate the plausibility of 1–5 GW campuses; use EIA to substantiate the state comparison."
