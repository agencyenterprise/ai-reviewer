        supporting_documents:
          - "data/case_1/supporting_1.md"
        chunk: "Prior work such as Smith (2020) and Doe and Roe (2019) provide useful background/insights."
        claim: "Prior work such as Smith (2020) and Doe and Roe (2019) provide useful background/insights"
      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: false
        rationale: "Only one supporting document (Smith, 2020) is provided which shows it investigates widget effects and presents experimental results—evidence of insights, but not that these are 'useful background.' The second cited work (Doe & Roe, 2019) has no supporting document. Thus, the claim that prior work provides useful background/insights is not adequately substantiated."
        feedback: "Provide the Doe & Roe (2019) document or quotes/details from Smith (2020) indicating its work provides useful background. Alternatively, soften the claim to 'prior work provides insights' or 'prior work has investigated this area.'"

        chunk: "cellphones have a positive impact on the user's writing proficiency in most countries (Smith, 2017)"
        claim: "Cellphones have a positive impact on the user's writing proficiency in most countries"
      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: false
        rationale: "The claim is directly contradicted by the cited supporting document. Smith & Anderson (2017) found 'conclusive evidence that smartphone use has no effect on writing ability of users,' which contradicts the claim of a positive impact."
        feedback: "The claim should be corrected to align with the cited research findings, or the citation should be removed and replaced with supporting evidence that actually demonstrates a positive impact."

        chunk: "This shift of activity into digital spaces has presented a multitude of difficulties, as well as opportunities, for criminal justice practitioners (Goodison, Davis, and Jackson, 2015; Tanneeru, 2009; Vermeer, Woods, and Jackson, 2018)"
        claim: "The shift of activity into digital spaces has created many difficulties and opportunities for criminal justice practitioners."
      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: true
        rationale: "Goodison et al. (2015) explicitly state that digital devices are ubiquitous and digital evidence is increasingly important to investigations and prosecutions (opportunities) while detailing significant challenges such as training gaps, courtroom understanding, and examiner backlogs. Vermeer et al. (2018) describes multifaceted legal, procedural, and technical difficulties in accessing remotely held digital evidence and identifies needs to improve access (difficulties and implied opportunities). Tanneeru (2009) reports experts noting that law lags behind technology and highlights emerging legal issues (jurisdiction, privacy, defamation), demonstrating difficulties posed by digital spaces. Together, these sources substantiate that the digital shift creates both difficulties and opportunities for criminal justice practitioners."
        feedback: "No changes needed."

        claim: "The shift of activity into digital spaces has created many difficulties and opportunities for criminal justice practitioners."
      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: false
        rationale: "No supporting documents are provided, so the claim cannot be substantiated."
        feedback: "Provide supporting documents that substantiate the claim."

        claim: "The shift of activity into digital spaces has not presented any difficulties or opportunities for criminal justice practitioners."
      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: false
        rationale: "All three cited sources explicitly describe significant difficulties and, in places, opportunities arising from the shift to digital spaces. Goodison, Davis, and Jackson (2015) report “significant challenges” in using digital evidence (training gaps for officers, prosecutors, and judges; backlogs; need for triage tools) and even reference “digital evidence opportunities and challenges.” Vermeer, Woods, and Jackson (2018) state that accessing remotely held digital evidence involves multifaceted legal, procedural, and technical difficulties and detail needs to improve MLAT processes, standards, and training. Tanneeru (2009) highlights that law lags technology and raises jurisdictional and legal complexity online. These directly contradict the claim that the shift has not presented any difficulties or opportunities."
        feedback: "The sentence appears to contain an erroneous negation."

      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: false
        rationale: "None of the cited sources explicitly state that blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger system that records transactions across a network of computers in a way that makes the data nearly impossible to alter without detection."
        feedback: "Provide references that explicitly support the claim."
