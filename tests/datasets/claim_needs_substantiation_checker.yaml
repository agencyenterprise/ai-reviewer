        rationale: "The statement is framed as a hypothetical scenario (“could allow,” “could…execute”) within a threat-modeling context and builds on nearby reasoning about agentic AI risks and potential common vulnerabilities. It does not assert new empirical facts, quantitative claims, or specific findings."
