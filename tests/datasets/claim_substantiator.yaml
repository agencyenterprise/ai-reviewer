        supporting_documents:
          - "data/case_1/supporting_1.md"

        claim_index: 0
      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: false
        rationale: "Only one supporting document (Smith, 2020) is provided which shows it investigates widget effects and presents experimental resultsâ€”evidence of insights, but not that these are 'useful background.' The second cited work (Doe & Roe, 2019) has no supporting document. Thus, the claim that prior work provides useful background/insights is not adequately substantiated."
        feedback: "Provide the Doe & Roe (2019) document or quotes/details from Smith (2020) indicating its work provides useful background. Alternatively, soften the claim to 'prior work provides insights' or 'prior work has investigated this area.'"

      description: "Test case for claim contradicted by supporting document"
      input:
        main_document: "data/case_1/main_document.md"
        supporting_documents:
          - "data/case_1/supporting_3.md"
        chunk: "cellphones have a positive impact on the user's writing proficiency in most countries (Smith, 2017)"
        claim: "Cellphones have a positive impact on the user's writing proficiency in most countries"
        claim_index: 0
      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: false
        rationale: "The claim is directly contradicted by the cited supporting document. Smith & Anderson (2017) found 'conclusive evidence that smartphone use has no effect on writing ability of users,' which contradicts the claim of a positive impact."
        feedback: "The claim should be corrected to align with the cited research findings, or the citation should be removed and replaced with supporting evidence that actually demonstrates a positive impact."
