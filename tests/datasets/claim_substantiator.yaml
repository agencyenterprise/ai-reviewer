        rationale: "Only one supporting document (Smith, 2020) is provided which shows it investigates widget effects and presents experimental results—evidence of insights, but not that these are 'useful background.' The second cited work (Doe & Roe, 2019) has no supporting document. Thus, the claim that prior work provides useful background/insights is not adequately substantiated."
        feedback: "Provide the Doe & Roe (2019) document or quotes/details from Smith (2020) indicating its work provides useful background. Alternatively, soften the claim to 'prior work provides insights' or 'prior work has investigated this area.'"

        rationale: "The claim is directly contradicted by the cited supporting document. Smith & Anderson (2017) found 'conclusive evidence that smartphone use has no effect on writing ability of users,' which contradicts the claim of a positive impact."
        feedback: "The claim should be corrected to align with the cited research findings, or the citation should be removed and replaced with supporting evidence that actually demonstrates a positive impact."

      expected_output:

        rationale: "Goodison et al. (2015) explicitly state that digital devices are ubiquitous and digital evidence is increasingly important to investigations and prosecutions (opportunities) while detailing significant challenges such as training gaps, courtroom understanding, and examiner backlogs. Vermeer et al. (2018) describes multifaceted legal, procedural, and technical difficulties in accessing remotely held digital evidence and identifies needs to improve access (difficulties and implied opportunities). Tanneeru (2009) reports experts noting that law lags behind technology and highlights emerging legal issues (jurisdiction, privacy, defamation), demonstrating difficulties posed by digital spaces. Together, these sources substantiate that the digital shift creates both difficulties and opportunities for criminal justice practitioners."

      expected_output:

        rationale: "All three cited sources explicitly describe significant difficulties and, in places, opportunities arising from the shift to digital spaces. Goodison, Davis, and Jackson (2015) report “significant challenges” in using digital evidence (training gaps for officers, prosecutors, and judges; backlogs; need for triage tools) and even reference “digital evidence opportunities and challenges.” Vermeer, Woods, and Jackson (2018) state that accessing remotely held digital evidence involves multifaceted legal, procedural, and technical difficulties and detail needs to improve MLAT processes, standards, and training. Tanneeru (2009) highlights that law lags technology and raises jurisdictional and legal complexity online. These directly contradict the claim that the shift has not presented any difficulties or opportunities."

      expected_output:
        is_substantiated: true
        rationale: "NERC’s 2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment explicitly flags rapid demand growth from large loads including data centers (crypto and AI) and notes that new resource additions are lagging behind what is needed, creating mounting resource adequacy risks and potential supply shortfalls. It states that the size and speed of data centers connecting to the grid present unique challenges, and that less overall (especially dispatchable) capacity is being added than projected and needed to meet future demand. RAND (Pilz et al., 2025) directly states that finding adequate power grid capacity is already a challenge for AI data centers and that it is not certain the U.S. is adding power quickly enough to accommodate AI data center demand, with evidence of increasing difficulty securing sufficient grid capacity. Together, these sources substantiate the concern that future AI data center loads for training and inference may exceed the capacity of grid additions."

        rationale: "The cited RAND report projects global AI data center power capacity needs of about 327 GW by 2030 (Figure 1.1; Chapter 1). It also frames results in terms of the share of AI compute retained in the U.S., e.g., noting that retaining a majority (75%) would require ~51 GW by 2027. Applying RAND’s 2030 global figure to a 50%–80% U.S. retention share yields roughly 164–262 GW by 2030; the stated 158–253 GW range is consistent with this order of magnitude and likely reflects rounding and/or treatment of current baseline capacity as “already present,” making the figures “additional.” Thus, the claim is supported by RAND’s global projection and its retention-share framing."

Applying a 50%–80% retention share to RAND’s 2030 global projection would imply roughly 160–260 GW in the U.S., not 50–100 GW. No 100 GW figure or 50–100 GW range for the U.S. appears in the report."
