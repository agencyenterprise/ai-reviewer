        is_common_knowledge: true
        common_knowledge_rationale: "Within the AI and energy domain, it is widely and routinely reported that training large AI models is energy-intensive. Policymakers and researchers (including DOE) and industry analyses frequently note high and rising data center power needs driven by AI workloads. The claim is qualitative and does not assert specific numbers, aligning with well-established understanding."
        substantiation_rationale: "As a qualitative, widely accepted fact, it generally does not require citation for this audience unless specific quantities or comparisons are introduced. If the claim were quantified or used to support specific policy choices, supporting evidence would be needed."

For an audience of policy and energy specialists, this is broadly accepted background knowledge."
        substantiation_rationale: "The claim is qualitative, reflects a widely accepted trend, and does not present specific quantitative findings or contested causal mechanisms."

        common_knowledge_rationale: "Within the AI and U.S. energy domain, it is widely and repeatedly reported by government, industry, and research sources that data center/AI electricity demand has been increasing; the claim is a general, non-quantitative trend statement that is broadly accepted by the intended audience."
        substantiation_rationale: "This is a widely accepted general trend rather than a specific quantitative or contested claim."
