"""Unit tests for the read_workflow_run_state chokepoint (RANDZ-561 PR 2).

The original History UI bug was that re-runs of a workflow type reused a single
langgraph_thread_id, so reading per-run state from the checkpointer returned the
*same* (latest) thread state for every run. Reading from each row's own
state_json fixes this: two runs that share a thread_id but carry distinct
state_json must hydrate to distinct states.
