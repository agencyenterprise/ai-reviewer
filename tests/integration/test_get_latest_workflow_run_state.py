"""Integration tests for get_latest_workflow_run_state_by_type.

This helper backs the prior-state seeding for accumulating workflows. Its SQL
must: pick the most recent run of the type/revision that actually has a
persisted state, skip runs whose state_json is NULL (including the just-created
current run), honor exclude_run_id, and scope by type/revision. A regression
here would silently drop or mix run state, so these exercise real rows.
